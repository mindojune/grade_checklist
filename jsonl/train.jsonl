turn the other direction", "Nurse:  So like if you have a 58", "Nurse: And you have 15 grams of carbohydrate", "Nurse:  Then you should be able to see within 15 minutes that it's going the other direction", "Nurse:  And so then maybe it would be instead of a 58 maybe a 69, you know or a 72 or something like that", "Nurse: It should turn and go the other direction", "Nurse:  If it's staying at the 58 or it's continuing to go down then we would have you take another 15 grams of carbohydrate until you see it turn around", "Nurse: There are three, several different things that can cause low blood sugars", "Nurse:  And I know we talked about this a year ago, but it's always good to look at it again because", "Nurse: A year ago we talked about a lot", "Nurse:  And so we call it the rule of 15", "Nurse:  And so if you're having a low or you feel like you're having a low, but it doesn't sound like you ever feel like you're having a low", "Patient: Usually I think I had one but I ate right away and it was okay after I told you I didn't I don't know what you just take my blood", "Patient:  I guess I should do it more often", "Nurse: Oh, yeah, if you feel like you're having a low or if you feel kind of crummy, or you feel like uh maybe I better eat", "Nurse:  Just go ahead I'll give you plenty of strips to check and see if you are low cuz if you are then you can maybe", "Nurse: If you can identify what it feels like if you're going low, it's really nice if you can identify it because if you say I'm felling kind of cranky right now, and you know, maybe I better eat something but check if you have your meter with you", "Nurse:  Check and", "Patient: See", "Patient:  That's the only bad thing", "Patient:  I don't carry it in my purse all the time", "Patient:  And I don't know if I should start", "Patient:  It's not a bad idea", "Patient:  Cuz usually when I do feel something like that I'm not at home", "Nurse: Right, and then there's there again", "Nurse:  That's the tricky thing then if we know that that's a low, then let's talk about what you were doing", "Nurse: And how you treated it and it could be that if you're having those midday lows then when I shift your morning dose and give you a little bit less in the morning and a little bit more in the evening", "Nurse: You know, so that's how we", "Nurse:  Of the glimiperide", "Nurse: That way we can tweak it so you're not having those lows midday", "Nurse:  You know, with just two over the course of six months or 3 months", "Nurse:  It's hard for me to identify was that just a one off or maybe you just had a salad and you were out walking around the mall or something like that", "Nurse: You know at lunch time", "Nurse: I can't relay it", "Nurse:  But if you do that then you're welcome to carry it with you", "Nurse:  You have the case that goes with it", "Nurse:  So just try to check it and see", "Nurse:  I'll give you some extra strips this time", "Nurse: Because then we can tweak your meds even better so that you're not at that risk of 50, it's pretty low", "Nurse:  I don't want to see you sitting there", "Nurse:  I'm glad you're not waking up with lows that's the first thing I'd look at", "Nurse: But I can see they're pretty pretty good in the morning", "Nurse: And you're more", "Nurse:  In your largest meals", "Nurse:  It's still the evening meal usually?", "Nurse: I just put no symptoms because you didn't have them", "Nurse: And then just a quick question you're not doing you don't have any allergies to speak of", "Nurse: But this is what I gave you a while back", "Nurse:  But we can always review it again and you can always take it with you too", "Nurse: Some causes of low blood sugar can be what's listed there", "Nurse:  Too much medication, that's why if you can not some lows midday then we'll certainly do some switching around being more", "Nurse: Active or eating less carbohydrates than what you normally do", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  So those are the reasons and then here are some of the symptoms", "Nurse: And I always chuckle about this", "Nurse: But that's how my mom used to get", "Nurse:  Irritable and then and then before, you know, she would be sweating", "Patient: She'd get cranky", "Patient:  I think I get more hungry", "Nurse: And that could be it, you know, and if you can identify it as a low then instead of unless it's mealtime instead of treating it with a lot of food than you can", "Nurse: Treat it with like 15 grams of carbohydrate and we talked a little bit about the carbohydrate", "Nurse:  Are you familiar with that? Okay and these are good choices for 15 grams and there are plenty of other ones out there, too, but that's", "Nurse: But the rule of 15 is just a way to make sure you're safe and not to over treat because if you over treat them what can happen is you can", "Nurse: Then you start bing bwinging, you know, you're like low and then you're high and then you're low and then you're high", "Nurse:  And so that's why we like to do it", "Nurse: This way unless of course it's time for supper and then you would just have your regular meal of course", "Patient: But that's do you do a lot of driving too? Not with Ron home I don't do much driving", "Patient:  He does most of my driving", "Patient:  I mean I drive some but not like I used to", "Patient:  So", "Nurse: because that would be the other piece too of course as if you were driving you don't always want to make sure that you weren't low", "Patient: There's a couple questions about driving I hardly drive at all", "Nurse: My husband used to drive all day and even now he's like", "Nurse: I don't mind at all", "Nurse: We both worked at FedEx, but he was all carrier for many years", "Nurse:  It was we were over there almost 20 years each or neither one of us are there anymore", "Nurse: It's where we met", "Nurse:  He would drive all day", "Nurse:  And I was okay with that because he was like this get there fast sort of thing I mean not speeding but getting out of the stoplight like", "Nurse: I'm pulling out of the driveway like you are not delivering packages here slow down", "Patient: I think I can use the restroom whenever you want me to", "Nurse: Oh that would be perfect that's perfect timing", "Nurse:  Put an extra piece on top of that", "Nurse:  This is just paper tape that helps it kinda keep it from flopping around while you", "Patient: That's pretty good stuff", "Nurse: And I got you tied down there real good", "Nurse:  I'll just put your water right over here where you can get it and I'll put a pen here in case you need it again", "Nurse: And then I'll take you out to the restroom", "Nurse: There's a little metal door you know we girls all know about that", "Nurse:  Bring it back", "Nurse: So", "Nurse:  We've got extra stuff here for you", "Nurse:  Do you have any questions on that?", "Patient: And I have one in my folder yet", "Patient:  So I'm going to give this one back", "Patient:  Okay, okay", "Nurse: I thought I'd seen that one before", "Nurse:  That's great", "Nurse:  Thank you for coming in", "Nurse:  This is an annual visit", "Nurse:  So happy one year anniversary", "Nurse:  These are we just have a little", "Nurse: Gift, it's not much but it's a little something something here for you", "Nurse:  This umbrella was a full-sized umbrella", "Nurse:  It's kind of nice", "Nurse:  I actually like it's like a golf umbrella good day for it", "Nurse:  Since it's raining out today", "Nurse:  Well, yeah, it was sprinkling anyhow", "Nurse:  And this is like a", "Nurse: Lunch box cooler about this big enough for carrying something in maybe in your car", "Nurse:  If you wanted to have something from this is a little LED light about this size", "Nurse:  This is a grocery bag", "Nurse:  It's the size of a grocery bag its lined in the lid", "Nurse: A zipper shut and at lays flat so it's nice for in the trunk of your car", "Nurse: A little pedometer here and a little salad shaker", "Nurse:  If you're interested in one of these things, I'd be happy that grab that", "Patient: I'll take an umbrella", "Patient:  We lost our big one someplace", "Patient:  This one is good for not the little tiny ones", "Nurse: I'm giving you five boxes of strips", "Nurse: And you have a box at home", "Nurse:  That should be plenty", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  I don't see you for 3 months now right?", "Nurse: So that gives you the opportunity to check some of those midday worms whenever you're staying outside if you have a 58 or 64 something like that take 15 grams of carbs and check it and see just to make sure it's turned around", "Nurse: Sit down at the table and then if you overtreat then you're overtreating and then you're having the meal and so then", "Nurse: Okay", "Nurse:  And it's cute that you said they were", "Nurse: And I the okay", "Nurse:  Yeah, I see where you got", "Nurse: High tide from the top", "Nurse:  Yeah, I should have took that it's the medication and then if you flip it over", "Nurse: this is the medication here on this side, too, but that", "Nurse: That's the little pink ones", "Nurse:  The 1 mg", "Nurse:  That one I know I'm gonna run out of", "Nurse:  The blue ones are fine because I've had them for a year that must be that bottle has a lot more in it", "Nurse:  I thought I looked and I think they were okay, but I'll check when I get home", "Nurse: When you get home and if they're if they're if they're going to expire before you come back in the spring will send you another one out", "Nurse:  Okay?

stolen", "Nurse: Call me right away obviously and I can stop payment", "Nurse:  Yeah I could render it 0 balance and then I could just make up the difference when you come back", "Patient: You would have enough money to save money if you have $130 if it's stolen", "Nurse: Yeah well there was one girl that I didn't know what to do because she her sheets heart oh she said that it worked for half of the past $100 but the other half she said she had like 6 or $70 left on", "Nurse:  And it did it didn't work anymore but she didn't have the car anyway of some kind of and I didn't know what to do and Jennifer dreams like you just just you know give her give her the benefit of the doubt", "Nurse:  Hear the extra money", "Nurse:  So I mean she's the boss", "Nurse:  Mark Fine Las he is he's usually the big boss but he is kind of winding down a little bit so that's why Jennifer going stepping up and she actually is the principal investigator he is just", "Patient: That is so I can stop", "Nurse: I'd like to say that out loud because he's used to be in the big cheese and I over the years have", "Nurse:  Have been I mean hit that starts with c", "Nurse: So I just I did not mention it like that I said that I said investigator I said okay so what I'm going to do I think that was that's the main thing I gave that to you the got this time let me go get your stuff and then we'll do your teaching", "Patient: Did she try to play with my mom which should be", "Nurse: I didn't for some reason I didn't see it I didn't see it in", "Patient: You want me to give you some whenever you're freezing", "Patient:  Alright I'll be right back", "Nurse: Alright so when we started this study they really didn't have money for a patient stipend but I mean that was just uncalled for we ever since unheard of we just felt like maybe something so", "Nurse:  Let me just tell you", "Nurse:  Okay so this is the same information that you saw in the consent form okay I want to go give you easier copy copy of microbiome and not that you're doing that one thing", "Nurse:  This is you know kind of where we've been so far that actually good this because this was a Juke laughed when I when I screamed you I got the other", "Nurse:  The other previous Duke a 1 seed and then this is the first the first time wow that's right this is your first final run in and then this was the retest okay alright so I wanted to give that to you", "Nurse:  So but now that you're being randomized to it you know might have a more vested interest in actually I know a little bit more about it", "Nurse:  So this there is a hormone and wieners we haven't known this that long in diabetes that people even have this for months but that's by the more the most recent drugs", "Nurse:  There's a hormone called glp-1 and are in our small intestine our gut and when we eat what happens is that hormone lights up is activated and it tells your hypothalamus hey", "Nurse:  Did you know blood sugar's going up here in need and then tell the pancreas that have the time one tells the pancreas to release some insulin", "Nurse:  We got came up with that money that were able to give we just come from somewhere else and these what they do what they", "Nurse:  So this is an all this medication is doing is just this is this is the synthetic form of glp-1", "Nurse:  And when we have found that people who have type 2 diabetes they either have a decreased amount of glp-1 and or just it's there but it's not very fun if it's probably a combination of both and", "Nurse:  You get to pick from", "Nurse:  A lunch box or an umbrella or that's where the thing that has two great love them off yeah so and if you don't mind it being big golf thing I mean some people really I mean that's not an umbrella but it's just big", "Nurse:  So we go ahead and give the lunch box to people who need to have refrigerated because we just felt like they really should do that", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  So it doesn't really matter now because our cars are kind of like the picture haters at the present moment but it does", "Nurse:  I'm going to El Paso", "Patient: Insulin resistance is just a lower level", "Nurse: Well it it keeps your it it Sparks your own insulin to get it go now what happens we've known for a really long time", "Nurse:  That people who have type 2 diabetes have what we like after meal problems getting the blood sugar back down again bless your goes up with everybody with or without diabetes dream but what happens is it sooner", "Nurse:  Blood sugar is elevated there are things that kick in like the insulin does talk to the hypothalamus but it's delayed with people who have type 2 diabetes", "Nurse:  This is one of the reasons", "Patient: Sacred Hogan golden is it scary always no matter where you have a long always says", "Patient:  Always in my hand really isn't", "Patient:  Man you are so lucky you got that stuff you were telling me", "Patient:  I have to start taking a nap", "Patient:  But that's just me", "Patient:  We almost finished", "Nurse: What is that blood thinner so that he can go through those vessels but talk to your doctor just flows easier through the blood vessels so you have a deep", "Patient: Now it's on her about arnicare 7 counter counter drug what's it call me in arnicare it uses its herbal thing on Earth has that kind of plant that they use with it but it sucks", "Nurse: Where do you get it at do you have to walk to Walgreens carries there's a couple of things that I had a lot of itching from a from a", "Nurse:  And I was about to die this girl told me about something called ditch the itch which is some kind of herbal thing yeah and it really did work", "Nurse:  But I had to go to Whole Foods to get it so I've learned that not all drugs are kept at Pharmacy on regular something real", "Patient: Coffee juices diet drink do you have do you have hot water I got to pee kiss and peanut butter", "Nurse: Alright so the glp-1 everybody has it all humans have it but we found out 20 years ago or so that people have diabetes doesn't work", "Nurse:  It don't let me give", "Nurse:  Glucose meter", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  Cuz we had a couple of we bought some extra machines a couple years ago but now the strips are all its fire bro", "Nurse:  You know the government", "Nurse:  Turn off the money to give meters to those who we don't have to worry about her safety issue low blood sugar okay and with Victoza and Metformin combination you don't have to work you don't you wouldn't have you wouldn't have a 9-1-1 love", "Nurse:  Now you could feel not right shaky whatever because it's been awhile since you ate and the medicines are doing your job and you may have had it delayed", "Nurse:  Meal of some sort so you could feel you know the symptoms of a low blood sugar and I still do go over because if you feel it's just not going to keep going down down down down if if you take too much as one or there was a pill called a morel that you could have been randomized to", "Nurse:  Very well and so this is one of the causes we take a pissy a logical reason why people who have diabetes have", "Nurse:  Then those they stimulate your pancreas to spit out extra", "Nurse:  Period now this one asked you to your bodies that out more insulin but it's what they call glucose-dependent this hormone only works if your sugar is elevated so as soon as it starts to go on the rise", "Nurse:  Cuz we're thinking a lot of times just to salivation if you're like Tina's smelling and anticipating the sugar starts to go up you know but anyway none the less this only works if the sugar is elevated if you take insulin", "Nurse:  Outside influence into your body pill Amaryl take too much of it it's going to work regardless putting on the dose I tell you to take and so for safety reasons there", "Nurse:  Providing the test strips in the end of glucometer now at some point if this doesn't work for you then you'll end up taking the Lantus anyway and then it's at", "Nurse:  Time then I'll give you the cash so what I was getting ready to say is that you know what", "Nurse:  What I do is try to fix the fasting blood sugar first but with this", "Nurse:  On it or you're not on it there is no way for me to end it individualize your dose", "Nurse:  Based on what your blood sugars are doing okay and so that's another reason why it's not of dire consequence you know that you check your blood sugar every day it's nice if you if you can use if you don't have to pay money for him or your insurance is paying for", "Nurse:  Okay well I mean we're going to every three months", "Nurse:  Clockwork we're going to get your A1C and if it's not working if this is not working then we've got the position built into the protocol that we would have answered your", "Nurse:  A hard time bringing the blood sugar back down again he goes up with everybody but with diabetes it goes up in the conscious stays up because if you if you're completely normal you're you're you're", "Nurse:  Medicine anyway to give you some insulin so now that you're in the study no matter what you get randomized to our goal is to get you blood sugar less than seven okay so in case you say his last name", "Nurse:  You see I knew it was something like you were supposed to pronounce the even on the end okay", "Nurse:  So I like that they have", "Nurse:  Anything else I want to say about this is what I want I give this to everybody no matter what their man in my tooth is a nice little teaching kit has nothing to his research", "Nurse:  It's just it's put out by biddy who makes syringes so they would like the needle so you'd like to them to buy but you're not going to buy because I'm going to pay for them and then this is Cesar the little cats that there they want State want to tell you the commoner", "Nurse:  Okay so you don't want any of that you may want diabetes care that's fine", "Nurse:  Well let's get these aren't going to be some none of these years now this kid does come with", "Nurse:  Hot three glucose tabs in a lot of people it's nice and Sleek small you can throw it in your purse and even though I tell you that you know you're not going to have a nine-one-one love what'll happen is as if anybody who has you know delayed food your blood sugar will go", "Nurse:  You'll get those symptoms and that's your body's way of", "Nurse:  Starting to tell your body your brain that you need to get that liver needs to produce some sugar out into the bloodstream", "Nurse:  Post-meal should pretty much equal your free meal after two hours and when you have diabetes for a lot of people that just does not happen", "Nurse:  So when you're on medication that can cause a low then obviously you don't know if you're going to be on too much medicine and then it's your body's not be able to now", "Nurse:  But when you're on these meds that don't mess with your pancreas and less of sugar is elevated anyway", "Nurse:  Yeah it will not keep over working so when you get those if you do get symptoms shaky sweaty irritable just really really hungry", "Nurse:  Then your bought your your your body will produce some sugar out to the bloodstream that's one of the function of the liver", "Nurse:  No net for Mustang it's the way that it works it just takes and takes already circulating insulin and helps to bring it into the cells okay so it doesn't stimulate the pancreas and then", "Nurse:  Stopping the liver from transport from", "Nurse:  Well yeah yeah well that's that's", "Nurse:  There's so much actually doesn't have anything to do with the glucagon", "Nurse:  I mean it actually start will slow that process down but you still are going to be able to release with Paul glucagon okay when you get that symptom you know when you if you were to get those symptoms", "Nurse:  So so this may be one of those though well I mean it is definitely something that would have to helps those after meal blood sugars okay now", "Nurse:  What does decrease the the production of sugar out into your bloodstream it does slow that down", "Nurse:  But you and I will say that mechanism trying to gets confused the glucagon if that's it over produces glucagon too much and in metformin is supposed to come slow that down cuz it's already an Overdrive", "Nurse:  But your body your your your body will still talk to your brain and I'll say you know you need to spit something out", "Nurse:  If you had diabetes a really long time that's usually I mean we're talking twenty plus years that whole mechanism Mike lately not not work anymore and and so", "Nurse:  Then you'd I guess you wouldn't be on on Foreman cuz it's no sense if you're still live alone basically", "Nurse:  I don't come back so you know I so even though I dog year the low blood sugars and then of course the high blood sugar too but", "Nurse:  It will help your blood sugar come down it will help your blood sugar come down but it's not going to cause like you can't over exercise and then the paramedics and be called at your whole passing out today you know", "Nurse:  If you exercise too much or you change positions a lot you know in the gym then they have a personal trainer okay yeah and it's so I'm sure that you know if you are", "Nurse:  Benefits if it quickly respond then your female the next time probably won't be you know so high because a lot of people are just trying to play catch-up all day long you know but the first order business but type 2 diabetes as we want to fix the", "Nurse:  Pass out then they know you have diabetes they probably are going to try to give you glucose just because you don't know if it's like your true passing out thing or you have diabetes that's fine I mean I can give it to you but you're not going to have like a load to the point where you really need to have the paramedics give you some", "Nurse:  Okay so if you're kind of out", "Nurse:  And so you know if you are treating yourself see what I tell people is that if even if you don't have a true low if you feel bad we all feel better having pain or something quick at", "Nurse:  That's why I even though I'm telling you that you don't need these these these glucose tabs you can certainly use them if it makes you feel better", "Nurse:  And bringing up just a little bit and when I like about glucose tabs or you know if your hard candy Lifesavers is that they're finite they're not like you know", "Nurse:  You only need 3 or 4 oz of regular soda and most people if they have regular soda and they're not feeling well still drink the whole can and that's too much sugar you don't want to and then we have something called read rebound high sugar you don't want that either and so", "Nurse:  Have a finite amount we say 15 grams", "Nurse:  With acting calorie now remember the second visit when when I told you that", "Nurse:  If you have something quick acting like straight sugar goes straight up and straight back down again so you don't want to do that if you are going to have sweet you want to have it at mealtime because you're probably going to have some protein and some fat protein fat and fiber slow the absorption okay like I was telling you visit", "Nurse:  Close the absorption but if you're not feeling well you obviously want to have something quick acting in this case", "Nurse:  Blood sugar so after having said that all about the postprandial you know", "Nurse:  Which again are and there's a places", "Nurse:  It gets going to be greater than an hour to you next to me then yes you want to have something which out what I call stick to your ribs or thing and you know that", "Nurse:  The peanut butter crackers where is the ice cream okay so it's it's telling you here what what what", "Nurse:  But so what to have in the reason why it has its ice cream cone with it because there's fat and ice cream yes there's a lot of sugar", "Nurse:  And it will bring sugar up and it won't bring it up as fast because it's got the fat and so you don't that's why you don't want it same thing goes with chocolate people want to treat themselves they don't usually get to have any not feeling well they in there low", "Nurse:  They want to have chocolate and that's that's also another thing you shouldn't have because you want to feel better as fast as you can okay", "Nurse:  So OK and then here they say eight Lifesavers so I thought it would I think I'm more like 6 but you know they say eight eight Lifesavers equals 15 grams of quick-acting carbohydrates", "Nurse:  So those in and out they let some other stuff like you fruit juicer", "Nurse:  Skim milk that's worth a six ounces of regular soda see I don't agree with that either I think it's 4 ounces but whatever at least it's not the whole thing now a lot of this stuff is not going to", "Nurse:  Be your not going to your not going to relate to it because you don't you're not taking insulin so don't you just disregard forever I've talked about injection site selection selects notations and", "Nurse:  Knowing you and you got to think of it I mean think ahead I'm going to go ahead and tell you that we're not going to mess with their worry about the post the after meals right now the afternoon blood sure we going to try to fix the fasting we always do because everything about research that's the best thing to do in and Diabetes Care", "Nurse:  You started this job I mean we were still taking some beef and pork", "Nurse:  And they were not as as they weren't they weren't human and so a lot of people and meet at Save-A-Lot alive you know but it it also created a lot of what we called antibodies and the things would happen on the skin if you didn't rotate them", "Nurse:  It's it's almost silly these days to make a big deal about this because everything is so clean and everything is just like a complete flown out of the", "Nurse:  The the the laboratory but technically you can give your injection anywhere where you have that okay it's trying to give it into the subcutaneous fat", "Nurse:  So I'm going to ask you", "Patient: Ariana pie is okay", "Nurse: So but there's been research that has shown that an injection technically work better in the abdominal fat because", "Nurse:  Or you hit that the muscle it's not going to hurt you it just might not work in the effective okay so I like to tell people you know didn't eat there there's there's no worries when you're taken", "Nurse:  Just so just to check how to change you know you're only taking one one one injection a day so you might just want to say all right this is this week", "Nurse:  And this is this week you know or something like", "Nurse:  Just something to make it easy you just don't want to", "Nurse:  Make a habit of going into the same exact area", "Nurse:  You know every single day so just kind of you know although it almost is just a silly thing and I will say that in the old days", "Nurse:  We should teach people you know to go in on a 45 degree angle but nowadays the needles are so tiny that you're going to go in perpendicular to wherever you're going to go get your medicine okay", "Nurse:  The medicine is not in bottles anymore well you can get them there you can get it that way but then the study has paid the extra money this is your medicine bottle", "Nurse:  So what I do is", "Nurse:  You know if you're taking it like in the back of your arms are on the welcome to the places we select are the backs of the arms the tops of the legs or the", "Nurse:  But if you take it in the back of your arm which one is actually really hard to get to you have to roll your arm up on the side of a door jamb you know that's the only reason how I know how to do it if you're taking it yourself", "Nurse:  But anyway lot of people you know that if you let's just use the tops of the legs because you can actually get to those and then you went out and did squats with your trainer what you doing is your kind of increasing", "Nurse:  That because you're making something hot and so things are going to dissipate more", "Nurse:  And so we just it's better to do it in in and you can go around to the to your to your back area your products area where you have fat lot of women have fat like right here", "Nurse:  And all the way if you just don't want to give it an inch", "Nurse:  You need it needs to be at least an inch away from your umbilicus and the only reason why I say that is because you just that's where you have stuff to taneous Pat starting you don't really have necessarily fat your whole bunch of fat right around the belly button area", "Nurse:  I was like to tell people that can't give an injection Raw it's not going to hurt you okay so if for some reason you don't get it deep enough", "Nurse: I gave you a couple of boxes of these which is way more than you need I don't know why they want me to give you two boxes but", "Nurse:  Your medicine bottles have to say so now now I have access there's a little because I had a needle that went down into that rubber", "Nurse:  Stopper and now this is what this is the needle okay to see how tiny it is you can pretty much and then obviously you don't want to recap with that pictures", "Nurse:  A recap of this and then I screw this soft like this", "Nurse:  And this can go you know what they ask is you get like a a really hard Harden like Clorox bottle or oh well you have a Sharps container", "Nurse:  Okay alright you go girl okay cuz most people they don't have and they did and I've have done studies before where they they Supply in but they don't Supply I'm here so I'm trying to think you know what the regular Joes do but if you have sharks", "Nurse:  And so awesome show Taft when it was on there are three", "Nurse:  There are three doses and because your body hasn't had this for a while work as well", "Nurse:  It's better to start at the lowest dose and get your body used to having that this this hormone again in your body that's active because it works in the gastrointestinal system lot of side effects stomach", "Nurse:  But you're going to have my aches and pains in your in your abdominal area you could have I mean that's really the most common and", "Nurse:  I'm going to give you a titration increase schedule but I don't want you to do what's on these this piece of paper", "Nurse:  I guess for now and forever more will give you one box because", "Nurse:  Unless you don't you don't feel well so if you if we're going to start you on the lowest dose destruido State 1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse: 8 1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse:  1", "Nurse: 8 in the beginning dose and it's going to say each week or going to increase your dose until you get on What's called the maintenance dose which is 1", "Nurse: 8 but if you are having any of these comments stomach discomfort nausea", "Nurse:  Vomit certainly call me if you're vomiting or diarrhea if you're having any of these then I don't want you to increase up to the 1", "Nurse: 6 or the 1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse:  Until you feel better until you feel", "Nurse:  You may not have any of this I've got I've had people come in and they're like I had no idea you made such a big deal about it and got I got nothing but you know just what to say it's very common and don't you know call me that's what I'm here for", "Nurse:  But we're not going to increase you until you really feel good at the at the lowest dose and then we're going to go to the middle dose and then once you feel OK at the middle dose it will go to the 1", "Nurse: 8", "Nurse:  I have a couple of people who are not able to take the 1", "Nurse: 8 for whatever reason your body could never get used to it that's okay we want on the highest dose that we can get you on that you feel ok", "Nurse:  But I had one lady actually", "Nurse:  Just could not eat anything she had absolutely no appetite and what it says is it beat it does tend to decrease appetite and the thought about that is that you know I was telling you that the hypothalamus", "Nurse:  Stimulated with the increase of this the other function one of the other functions of our hypothalamus is that's our satisfaction Center so we're thinking that if that if I profound this is now being lit up", "Nurse:  In case we go over there's a hundred of them so what I do and also if you forget to rub with alcohol it's going to kill you", "Nurse:  The people are are not are not as hungry and that's the reason why are they push away from the table I eat much less do not be surprised if you eat much left okay", "Nurse:  Just go with it I mean I in the end because I had that one girl I want to make sure that I say I want you to get your nutrition and if you cannot eat your nutrition", "Nurse:  Then that's a problem but if you know just go with it just just know that that's a side effect decrease appetite don't freak out and and enjoy it you know be happy about it", "Nurse:  Yeah it probably you're probably eat about half food that you've been watching that used to okay in some people most people I mean obviously it's got to be a lot of people because otherwise they would not have gotten an FDA indication", "Nurse:  Okay but it's not something like an amphetamine", "Nurse:  It's going to be alright", "Nurse:  Why people forget now if you're straight out of the shower", "Nurse:  You may want to even you can don't even have Nestor leaves I'll call you know I should do is use your skin is clean it is a drying agent so you know they say if you find that it's just", "Nurse:  Not helping email your skin trying out too much you can do it after shower anyways you supposed to take rubbing alcohol and supposed to rub on your on your", "Nurse:  And then I'm going to show you how to do it first and then your Sis's where you go to put the needle so you're supposed to clean with alcohol like this okay and", "Nurse:  Feel this out to see there's like a little needle in there that's what's going to puncture", "Patient: No no no no no", "Nurse: It's just it's a whole different pathway", "Nurse:  Call different whole different ball at has nothing to do with that has nothing to do with that pathway okay so", "Nurse: This was the reason why I asked if you've ever had pancreatitis coming into the study cuz some people do a small number have an increased chance of pancreatitis", "Nurse:  And there is some people who have Pinot severe diarrhea but that doesn't have to pay for Titus so so slim I do like to tell people that", "Nurse:  But it is in there so you know I like you", "Patient: Recent I mean since I started with the study at them the metformin and periodically but it's not it's not like every time you go you know several times or whatever but when it is it's like so I just want to call back because it's fluid stool but it's not something that it's like like what you get when a 24-hour right right and so", "Nurse: Yeah really I dread every day", "Nurse:  Switch a tag on 50 La make you start doing it at 50 cuz I'll be 50 in January they make you start doing", "Patient: I started when I was earlier", "Nurse: Well so you know that's the metformin talking obviously okay so I'm actually if you were going to have some glad that you at least have a Baseline and you try to know so if you have any added diarrhea then we'll just", "Nurse:  Stuff that we are distributed now that was me by biddy in this was made by the grade I keep that stuff in", "Nurse:  Person that", "Nurse:  A lot of people depend on what I was going to say that people who have had Tire a higher", "Nurse:  Content for the day or the meal do you have a greater chance of having diarrhea when you're taking metformin and so people who have a lot of diarrhea", "Nurse:  Get them to you eDispatch so and I always let all so you know if it ever comes to the point where it's just changing your quality of life then", "Nurse:  You know I mean it sounds like it's not I'll be but I'm just one I like for people to be after work", "Nurse:  Feminine protection because of a urinary tract infection if I have time okay well you just need to let me know because I definitely want people on the most", "Nurse:  The the Matt Foreman that'll do the job because there's so many pluses and not very many minuses but for some people that is big- you know if they can if you can't you know", "Nurse:  You need to let me know okay so what we're going to do first and it even goes in the tops a little bit on these these about the low blood sugar see now here at Sam forum", "Nurse:  Have orange juice in three to four Lifesavers they're not being consistent and the", "Patient: You know yeah it's it's", "Nurse: Not necessary okay you may find that just getting but it's it's nice to have just because it it makes everybody feel better if you", "Nurse:  Some some kind of calories circulating your body will kick in and will eventually give some some glucagon and and it up your blood sugar will come up your body will do it for you", "Nurse:  But you know it's always nice to have a couple of you know hard candies or something I think you know with or without diabetes", "Nurse:  But it's not like you need to do that this this you could happen", "Nurse:  Not like that whenever something else thinking when we were talking about that", "Patient: President still has to be referred", "Nurse: So what so what I've been trying to get this more because", "Nurse:  Alright well they will think about this now then", "Nurse:  That's what I was thinking is that first of all when you're traveling I like for you to keep something on your person and then something else in your life put this in your purse and then put in fits and another pair so or something in your carry-on bag", "Nurse:  But definitely don't hurt okay good okay okay it's just nice to have like in two different places in case somebody takes your carry-on bag and then you like off", "Nurse:  You know at least you have to have him to different places but I don't check your don't ever check your medicine okay alright so", "Nurse:  Like go ahead just take the first the first person I'm just so that you kind of have a good feel for thing but", "Nurse:  At the pens are good for 30 days at room temperature", "Nurse:  Okay if you if and when you get up on the max dose and you go through them pretty quickly I mean I'm giving you", "Nurse:  416 Penn not to last you until like the beginning of February so technically you know I shut this well you put it in the fridge when you get home", "Nurse:  And then you know you think I keep these in the fridge until you're ready to use it so they're getting a shirt or anything that's the thing up", "Nurse:  Yeah so what I tell people is that if it gets hot then it's not going to hurt you to take it it just may not be effective okay so you know whenever you go abroad", "Nurse:  We'll just have to think how how how to do things I mean you may just have to take", "Nurse:  Couple of author", "Patient: Since I keep my medicine medicine in my backpack and then I can let me know what the immediate dose is in my backpack the other associates", "Nurse: So what what I would do is I'm so you're not going to need to take all of this but you know I would put like a whole box just know that I feel whatever I don't take it's going to get wasted after 30 days", "Nurse:  That way at least you'll have I would put more you're going to be gone for how many days", "Patient: December 30th to January okay", "Nurse: So you'll have one box would be enough so I would take a whole box I would take two boxes and just know that you're going to have to waste", "Nurse:  And I'll go and if I kept", "Patient: Frigerator", "Nurse: Then it's it's good till the expiration date", "Nurse:  I was just thinking that you might not be able to keep it refrigerated it's not like you're going to Sheraton where that you're going to have a mini fridge or are you", "Patient: I will be going and that one oh okay but I actually have my son used to have growth hormones and they had and they had up a little case with with a", "Nurse: Blue thing", "Patient: Have the now I wouldn't have been I mean probably not placed for multiple pens", "Nurse: Yeah I still think this will be enough and maybe at you don't take a whole box because you're only going to be gone for 10 days", "Nurse:  I have to I'll have to figure out and also I have to see how fast your going to come up to 1", "Nurse: 8 you know because technically however you tie should you try to trade up really quick you might need some you know you obviously are going to have to take more", "Patient: If I have if I have the", "Nurse: Right well so yeah so if you have the ability to have one I mean this last a long time you can take this and then you can put you know all your stuff in there except for like a pen that you're going to hold out here I still think I would put I would I would just know I'm going to have to burn one", "Nurse:  Just because well we'll just have to see how long it how long it takes you to get up I need you to shut up", "Nurse:  Because I'm trying to think about something I don't have the answer cuz I don't", "Nurse:  And I can also figure it out", "Patient: The things to keep those cold too yeah I needed it with the other yeah", "Nurse: I don't know in fact I haven't seen those Stanford", "Nurse:  Get a prescription there and then it was okay baby", "Nurse:  Insulin a long time I guess we used to have to keep hormones just really stable and in the refrigerator and now there's been enough stability testing for the insulins that air on that they're just we know that they're stable and so it's not of dire consequence if you know", "Nurse:  Keep it cold all the time", "Nurse:  So I guess they just you know just have kind of gotten out of talking about and selling those sorts of things but we'll just figure out how fast you and then I can figure out better you know how long it's going to take for you to go to a go go through a pen", "Nurse:  December 30th and that and then I want a time to fight you I want to double it cuz I want you to put however much you're going to need in your purse and I want to put the same amount in your carry-on in case somebody's wipes it", "Nurse:  And then we're just probably if you keep this cold if you keep the cold and I'm not to worry about", "Nurse:  You know and then you might be going through these depend on how fast is if you have to just throw it then you have to throw away but I would like for you to have like duplicates just so that you don't have to buy ahead of guy who went to Paris", "Nurse:  Play I did all this", "Nurse:  It all out and he forgot to bring along an extra metformin so we were over like trying to get some friends doesn't know what you know he did get some medicine but you know I'm trying to figure out how to", "Patient: No problem", "Patient:  Doctor she forgot forgot to say", "Patient:  It's just a Peru", "Nurse: Will say that this guy went to Paris I mean it wasn't terrible but you know cuz they do have stuff there but they call it something else and it worked out okay but it's just easier if you don't have to go down that", "Nurse:  You could have a little bit of sea veg back out of where you just injected we tried we tell you too you know get all your medicine count 5:10 something like that I just count 5 slowly and then pull out and it's a little bit comes out", "Nurse:  What you what you going to do you know it just that this way it is you know you might want to count to ten next time", "Nurse:  Okay so this picture I really don't want to be with it looks like this man taking just a little bit of his skin and I like to take like it actually if you sit down and you sit up usually most of us have enough overhang", "Nurse:  But you don't even have to pets OK or I like to call it you know you kind of get a man Mitch", "Nurse:  Yeah I love handle Matt does anybody even know what a manwich if you're old enough to know how we need to stop using that as an example I don't think they have those anymore", "Nurse:  Anyway so it's just that if you take just a little bit of skin and you pants you're actually trying to create a bruised and so you want to be just kind of just to nip the the fat", "Nurse:  Yeah and just really you don't even have to do anything just you know stood up and you get enough so so I like to kind of mix", "Nurse:  Mention of that and then the other thing is that you are technically creating puncture wound technically you know and so you could hit like a little tiny blood vessel capillary sort of thing and he could get some bruising", "Nurse:  Don't worry about it it happened that shouldn't happen every time you know I mean you do have blood vessels feeding in up to it into the skin", "Nurse:  Also when because of the puncture wound like when you pull it", "Patient: I don't have I do have but I do work my abdominal muscles when I work out", "Nurse: No it's not in that it's not I mean any of his do you have to take this one today and they let it doesn't matter what time of the day they would like for people to pick a time and plus or minus a couple hours stick to that particular time of the day", "Nurse:  Because you know just better it's just it's better rep with your blood sugars that are stable that", "Patient: If I take my metformin in the morning and in the evening", "Nurse: I mean that seems kind of it doesn't it wouldn't be very what's the word I'm looking for convenient", "Nurse:  Man in the middle of the day usually people will pick you know like a I just rather take it in the morning get it over with or you don't take it with my my my metformin in the evening", "Nurse:  Some people are like because you want to make sure you're home and a lot of times you're out and about in the middle of the afternoon if you are somebody who has gastrointestinal issues with this medicine I will say that more people tend to", "Nurse:  Tolerate in the evening if they take it to me", "Nurse:  You may be one of these people are like I don't feel anything anyway but you know you can take it in the middle of the day if you want to meet at just would be inconvenient this really does work okay so it's not like you know you're taking it in the middle of day cuz I need to have some coverage there", "Nurse:  It's not that it's not that you know this is a 24-hour I mean you're working off of blood level so that you know like when they started Prozac they probably told you it's like you're not even feel good for a week or two you know so you know I tell you the same thing when you if you're checking your blood sugars don't get", "Nurse:  Upset if your blood sugar is for the next week to 10 days aren't the same as they vent you know", "Nurse: So you know I we're just taking it in the middle of the day today just because that way I know that you know where you don't have any questions and you know mediately you're not sitting home by yourself then I'll what the heck did she say", "Nurse:  I say a lot I do say a lot", "Nurse:  Okay the way they make this pen is obviously you're in the plunger comes up you're going to take what you need and you going to push all the way back down to zero and you don't necessarily have to see the zero but you know some people are holding like this 10 matter", "Nurse:  But you know tell you you're gone all the way down when you first start and again if you forget to do this it's not going to hurt you", "Nurse:  But you have to think you're going to have", "Nurse:  Why don't we start from scratch right and then when you get there I'll show you", "Nurse: Sometimes people they might you might want to not hit right up on a stretch mark because the vasculature underneath there is no that doesn't find one", "Patient: Well you probably should have yeah yeah you probably should have been I never I never used to haul with my", "Nurse: That you don't want to put on really really tight because you got to take it right back off again that's okay you already did now", "Nurse: And you obviously don't have problems sometimes I have okay then you take out the other one okay now what I want you to do is what I was getting ready to tell you is you want that you have a little bit of air well see you look these that you're already getting a little something coming out of", "Nurse:  Usually we do what's call the air shot where you want to make sure that you've got nothing in in the the two cuz you don't want to Rob yourself that much medicine so you see this little this little Mark right here I can dial it all the way up and", "Nurse:  If I over dial that's nice to know some of the other pens don't do that but it's usually like a couple of clicks", "Nurse:  Up to this dude got this here for your air shot and you push that out now you've been as long as you're good see you really didn't have to do that but I'm just showing you the proper alright now you're going to take the test you go up to the first thing you're going to start with ", "Nurse: 6 as long as that's lined up and then that's what you're going to take at least for the next week", "Nurse:  Wednesday so", "Nurse:  They go in all the way down and then one 1023 4000-5000 pull out", "Patient: Just a drop that's fine", "Nurse: Just to drop him so used to doing things for people yeah", "Patient: He said you can get it off so sometimes it's really hard to get it back off again", "Nurse: Obviously done for today so you can just kind of pic you can just kind of pic you know whatever time it is most convenient for you and if you want to take it or know that you can you know but", "Nurse:  You know those people it's like", "Nurse:  I mean you know I'm always home at whatever time and I'm not as not as crazy trying to get food on the table or you know it really is a convenience question okay", "Nurse:  All right any questions about that", "Nurse: And you know darn well stay at your blood sugar should happen in fire 6 hours but my my personal experiences that you know people tell me it home I got my bus still have the next morning", "Patient: At what do you have an idea as to what it cut up to", "Nurse: Now I can check your blood sugar yeah I can check your blood sugar I'll do that for you yeah let me go get it is that you cuz we know what your starting point", "Patient: You guys did everything I'm going to do it here", "Nurse: Alright so just use what's important and it's you if you misplace this I give one out to people again when they", "Nurse:  Started okay so you know but I like to give it to people even though they're not starting insulin because some of it is is perfect to your your parents need okay so there's two boxes of bees", "Nurse:  100", "Nurse:  So you got plenty there's this and then I put 2 200 count metformin okay", "Patient: Birthday", "Nurse: So let me just make sure that we understand all that", "Nurse: So you're going to do the point I think it's all you want me to do a blood sugar", "Patient: Fasting every day", "Nurse: You know if if it were me and I had access to it I would want to do that", "Nurse:  If I add some it really is not", "Nurse:  Absolutely necessary cuz there's nothing we can do anyway see it's just with right now if it's still a little bit elevated we know that we're not going to do anything with that none", "Nurse:  Except that just nice to know it's starting to come down but you're not going to make it a clinical change based on okay we know it's going to be a little bit High we remember", "Patient: Accountability", "Nurse: Yeah yeah yeah", "Nurse:  Yep yep that's very that's very true I know and so a very confusing I don't know what I was going to tell you so", "Nurse:  It can be very confusing and that's why it's so nice", "Nurse:  Do a glucose test strips I mean most of my studies", "Nurse:  I just give it to some people and not others but I understand money thing but it's nice to know I mean you can sweat for many different reasons is it my blood sugar okay okay yeah I know or you know your whole blood pressure thing that you know you talked about so", "Patient: 6 everyday until next month", "Nurse: But what I was going to tell you before I forget again is that your sugar has been running fairly High", "Nurse:  With type 2 diabetes because then you can rely on the metformin to help during the day plus you're doing some exercising plus just even if you're not exercising you're up moving around and even just up moving around helps your motivate your insulin work", "Nurse:  He said if you start off high you're just trying to play catch-up all day and you just never can", "Nurse:  It's different with type 1 diabetes that they don't have either on insulin or lying but you have yours and I'm so glad I hated that you got as high as you did but it's nice to know that you can do that on that you stare useful information so you still got a fair amount of your own get up and go", "Nurse:  That you can do that without medication change so may still not normal but it's it's if that's good information so yes to be practical and summarize everything you're going to take somewhere in here it says you're starting dose stereo", "Nurse:  Is ", "Nurse: 64 going to take that for a week and if you feel great", "Nurse:  1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse:  After a week if you feel great it just says increase", "Nurse:  Quite a while okay about anyone sees okay and we're trying to bring it down to normal", "Nurse:  So if my blood sugar is running 200 and then I start running 100 100 a good number okay it's not low", "Nurse:  But my body is used to being 200 so you could feel some of those symptoms this is not a good reason to check with your machine you may not get this I've had people who are like again I don't know what you're talking about Jennifer", "Nurse:  Nothing that's fine great I'm glad but if you're some people go through that where they it's like quitting smoking you know it's a good thing but you don't have that nicotine you're like so what are you do you take a little nicotine gum", "Nurse:  So with you if you do feel those symptoms just like I was telling you take a couple of you know for for Lifesavers or so you know", "Nurse:  Your training your body to feel normal with a better number so don't freak out it's common with a lot of people okay cuz that's been a while since your blood sugars been that that that low and that's our goal is to try to get the fasting down to 100 if you get the fasting down to 100", "Nurse:  More than likely the rest of the day will follow if if you're going to be a statistical person you know if you're going to be in to the end of the main population of people in this in this regard your your you will be able to feel I mean if you fix your fasting you'll have an A1C at goal lessons", "Nurse:  Good fasting blood sugar is Sookie", "Patient: Air shot on every time", "Nurse: Cuz you're putting on a new needle every time and that was in that information it'll say that it's best to take it off", "Nurse:  Because you could you know it it changes in the in the in the winter time everything can strips and so it could actually suck more air into the syringe and the opposite it could you know spit it out and it's hot outside so this says you will increase but I didn't get to make this dispute pay", "Nurse:  You know this disinformation one of the great job did so because what I'm saying is you won't do this much chill okay that's going to be your maintenance okay and now all this stuff I didn't put in my phone number because you have all that in your phone right", "Nurse:  And a lot of times I'm not at my dad or I just work part-time always goes to work part-time anyway so call me because I might not be here and I'd much rather you go ahead and call me with a question and then you got it", "Nurse:  Stalled in 5 minutes then have to wait a day or so you know till the next morning or when", "Nurse:  So I can finally call you back", "Nurse:  That's one of the perks in the study so you know use it because you have when you have my cell phone number so you should use it okay", "Patient: I'm just now will it stop by now", "Nurse: It won't last very long okay I need to give you enough parking stickers and need to make an appointment and then I think we're done", "Patient: Cheats for me right now duh I just keep up", "Nurse: I will call you next week okay", "Nurse:  But you sometimes people have already gone on up to 1", "Nurse: 2 by the time I call them with their week follow-up so if I don't hear from you I'm still going to call you next week just because just because just", "Nurse:  And I'm so but if you have felt fine after a week and I don't call you you know inside of a week you know yeah star my 1", "Nurse: 2 s'more and I'm feeling a fine you know", "Nurse:  But then some people they won't start feeling bad till they get up to the 1", "Nurse: 2 and 1", "Nurse: 8 so it's almost kind of silly that I call you next week I really would you know better if I do a two-week all but what", "Nurse:  I can do it too we call to they just really want me to call you", "Patient: Therapeutic level for Thanksgiving", "Nurse: I know if you so easy to turn it off man I mean I keeps going around and tell myself I cannot be trusted I can trust", "Nurse: I seriously I do that as my internal because I got so much crap in my in my house with kids and all their Halloween candy and it's I don't know why but I am such a cheap", "Nurse:  Person I like the cheap stuff I'm just and it's all can it's all sweet and I'm like I can't have one so", "Patient: Does this mean I can I still have to eat Milo Milo diet and terms of no carbs no", "Nurse: I mean you need to be you again", "Nurse:  I mean I know you kind of put yourself on an you know boot camp sort of thing but yeah just trying to get your A1C down cheap that mean you need to find some happy medium that you can live from work", "Patient: That people say oh well it's not it's not just a diet it's a lifestyle this is something I have to keep going forever", "Nurse: Good kind of stress that you do at seriously for six weeks to get your A1C back down", "Nurse: You know of course if you if you ate you know cardboard all the time and there was no carbohydrate your your blood getting out it would be easier to control your blood sugar but that's just not realistic I don't want you to go crazy you know and so you know but just like", "Nurse:  Tree tree exchanges of a meal or you know I mean that is what raises your blood sugar it is that's what raises your blood sugar are carbs", "Nurse:  But you know carbs they are they do serve us a function I mean I have that's the the carbohydrate that I mean that's the that's the the nutrient that our brains want to", "Nurse:  Live on all the time and that's why you get these kind of dizzy shaky sort of things going on", "Nurse:  When your brain is not getting enough enough blood sugar and not shut up to it yeah well and so you know I know that you have put yourself on a really decrease tomcar diet the last 6 weeks to get dry when she back down again", "Nurse:  You know so", "Nurse:  You just need to find what is realistic for you okay I mean cuz you know I have a feeling that what you been doing over the last six weeks you just can't maintain that and it is supposed to be a lifestyle", "Nurse:  You know well I mean", "Patient: That's what I", "Nurse: Let me know if you're having like three three servant you know three extella I tell you a servings not much remember it's just the size of your fist you know so this is you know some potatoes you know when you feel like half of a baked potatoes are so huge these days", "Nurse:  But you know if you can look and see what a serving sizes but mainly you want to stay you know about this small and so if you had you know a couple of", "Nurse:  For mealtime or 3i would be acceptable you know it's just not much 15 grams of carbohydrates is not much cannot discern carbohydrate", "Nurse:  So and it's so it's really hard to stick most people will say well III I aim for two and then I know I end up going to three", "Nurse:  Because it's so hard to get fully 15 grams at the car so I really just pick two carbs for the meal and then I'll have some overflow", "Nurse:  And if you go out to eat you better cut the carbs in half cuz they serve you so many carbs at a restaurant because they're cheap", "Nurse:  But I don't eat rice", "Patient: Okay me and vegetables and hang on usually not carrot for", "Nurse: Eating low-carb anyway", "Patient: Unless it's I mean I do your sums are the carbs that are high in protein like Black beans or more of those burritos naked with me", "Nurse: So I mean if if you can live that lifestyle I think that's awesome you know but you know I don't want you to go through the rest of your life like you know just craving carbs you can't you're not going to take", "Patient: The more you get away from the less you crave so much more understanding now of people who have addiction issues because of how hard it is for me you know one one carb and I'm like ghetto for me man right now", "Nurse: Yeah that's why I keep telling myself but I'm getting it in room fall at that although speed attacking be trusted", "Patient: Right now", "Nurse: So you know you need to do what you need to do so that you don't fall off the wagon supposed to say but if you do fall off just get back on again you know", "Patient: What happened in the past is when I'm on my way is gotten considerably less which is a very good chance especially now since I'm", "Nurse: You've already lost some lofts", "Patient: And then I'm losing it you know", "Nurse: Maybe that maybe more with it Victoza", "Patient: A1C comes down could I come off of the metformin and keep the Victoza", "Nurse: Cuz cuz that's what you know and what we do is will cut it in half I mean I'm going to take you off of it right away I mean you know the whole thing but it whatever we could do is like cut it in half and at format and it keeps", "Nurse:  Especially since you have occasional diarrhea now you know that would be a good thing to do if if and when", "Patient: Continues to suppress appetite my own insulin kicks in the less the less weight I have the link", "Nurse: Yes it and I'm for a lot of people like you know what I'm starting insulin if this point with some people you know we would probably come down on the insulin before the mat for me", "Nurse:  And in we just walk it down if you mean what what I do is I walk up meds I can walk down meds and if the answer is zero", "Nurse:  The answer zero it just depends on you know you have to look at the complete picture which of the meds would would it be best beneficial to you to decrease and in this case it would it would be to cut the metformin and keep the Victoza", "Patient: What are the questions", "Nurse: Let me go get the calendar and routes", "Nurse: So you don't have to for another year so at the end of each year like will at the end of this coming year will repeat today see how you know how far we come", "Nurse:  But we always

"Nurse:  And we get a urine for protein every other time and that's just American Diabetes Association standard that we try to follow", "Nurse: Put all those down in the computer we have to can take

much easier for people", "Nurse:  And much less painful they finally designed the needles that people don't even feel it I have people that use this", "Nurse:  The needles and they have to look in the mirror because they don't even feel the needle going in their tummy so they're not sure they're giving themselves an injection", "Nurse:  So that is all good news finally", "Patient: Finally finally alright", "Nurse: Let me go get rid of some stuff and I'll be back and we will do the teaching", "Patient: Have a seat over here when you're ready", "Nurse: You're ready for your morning nap", "Nurse:

don't know that they're there the older they get", "Patient: The other one is ", "Nurse: Okay alright so", "Nurse:  Just make sure I got the time so I do your next draw", "Nurse: In this folder that you're going to take home it's got all of our information so here's me my email address and my phone number we give you this neat little card that tells you your on your metformin and this medication cause you can put it in your wallet so anybody knows and what's great is on back of it has our number and stuff so you can always get a hold of us even if you don't are not home", "Nurse: Please", "Nurse: So what I'm writing on here", "Nurse:  I'll go over this with you", "Nurse: So what this medication like I told you you're going to start at the 0", "Nurse: 6 okay so you'll dial it to the 0", "Nurse: 6 and you will stay on that dose you're going to inject it in your tummy you need to make sure that you rotate all over your tummy yep all over the place people getting a habit of constantly injecting it into the same area", "Nurse:  You will start to get hard tissue there and you just need to make sure that you rotate so you're going to stay on that dose for about 5 to 7 days if no side effects the most common one like I said is nausea", "Nurse:  As long as it's not severe and you feeling okay with it then you go up to the next dose of 1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse:  Same thing 5 to 7 days if no problems you go up to the max dose", "Patient: Okay", "Nurse: I've had some people and I'll be talking to you in between to see how you're doing on these steps", "Nurse: You could have vomiting but it's not as common usually we find that it if anybody has vomited it's because I ate too much", "Nurse:  In your body and we'll see how things go", "Nurse:  So this medication makes you feel full so listen to your body and when you're full don't eat anymore because it slows down the gastric emptying in your stomach so what you eat since they're a little bit long", "Nurse:  If you keep feeling it", "Nurse:  It wants to come back up because it has no room for it as long as people listen to their body", "Nurse:  They'll do you'll do just fine okay so that's the that's the Great side effect of this medication is you don't want to eat as much people are losing weight okay", "Nurse:  Anywhere I have people from Thats lost 5 pounds up to almost 50 pounds so depends", "Nurse:  And everybody's different so we're not sure how this is going to act in your body and we'll see how things go", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  So other good thing about this medication is let's say you get up to the max dose the 1", "Nurse: 8 and you're just miserable you are so nauseous you can't go on about your day the great thing is as you can go backwards so you can go back to the 1", "Nurse: 2", "Nurse:  Stay there for a little bit see if you can build back up on another day so that's what's kind of nice about this medication but usually people just can build right back up to the 1", "Nurse: 8 and then they stay there and do well so we'll give your first dose before you leave today", "Nurse:  What's nice is every day before your injection you put a new pants needle on and it's a simple as screwing that on", "Nurse:  There's your tiny needle", "Patient: Okay", "Patient:  And then getting rid of it", "Nurse: Actually don't put this one back on cuz I guarantee you're going to poke yourself this one", "Nurse:  This one", "Patient: Unscrews and then that", "Nurse: This a lot of people do a different couple of things so some people will take a little pen and just bend that needle back", "Nurse:  But I recommend if you do use liquid laundry detergent", "Patient: Yes sometimes", "Nurse: So if you can save an old bottle or if you have anybody that has an old bottle that they can give you these fit great in there nobody can get their hands in there to get the needles out when that jug is full you can put your lid on it and it can go in your regular trash so that is acceptable", "Nurse: Having things like those to get rid of needles are expensive and a lot of people won't take them back pharmacies won't take them cuz they're very expensive for them to get rid of so most people in my studies use Liquid laundry detergent or Clorox bleach", "Nurse:  Orange juice milk jugs are not thick enough and you cannot use those okay", "Nurse:  So we're going to save this aside", "Nurse: This one the one you're using everyday can be out of the refrigerator does not have to go in the fridge and it will last for 30 days out of the refrigerator", "Nurse:  But you'll go through it", "Patient: The other ones are supposed to be in the fridge until you", "Nurse: All the extras just keep them in the fridge till you need them", "Nurse: Okay cause they'll last a year in the refrigerator they all have expiration dates and most of them are a year inside the refrigerator", "Nurse:  Here it is August of 17", "Nurse:  But like I said you'll be gone through them every time you come see me every 3 months you'll be pretty close to the end and you'll need all new ones", "Nurse:  Do you travel a lot on an airplane?", "Patient: No", "Nurse: Cuz it really easy to travel with I have people that use these with insulin and these and they travel overseas and they don't have any difficulty going on and off the airplanes I think TSA is very used to them now", "Nurse:  Okay so there's that and this talks about just what I said about going up on your dose", "Nurse:  And adjusting your medication this sheet right here talks about the common side effects which I went over with you so nausea is number one some people vomiting some people have reported some sense of diarrhea even constipation", "Patient: At the same time", "Nurse: So but really nausea is the most common okay I have majority of people have no side effects whatsoever", "Nurse:  If you forget to take your medicine if your next scheduled dose is within 12 hours just skip it okay so if you missed it that much take it in the morning what time do you take your other pills?", "Patient: When I wake up", "Nurse: So have this by your pills", "Nurse: That's fine and it can be like an hour or so leeway it's not a big deal it's just the more consistent it is 24 hours apart it goes better okay", "Nurse: So just put your pen by your pills and when you swallow your pills take your injection and you'redone no good luck with that", "Patient: Inject the pills and swallow the pen okay", "Nurse: I think it sounds pretty painful that your email about your metformin so we just put that in there and then there's just more information about your Victoza", "Nurse:  Just in case you get home and you forget anything I say about the pens that's what this is and it will go step by step on how to do your pens", "Nurse:  But we're going to give you first injection here", "Nurse:  And then this one is different sites that you it says an insulin but it's any injectable medication that is sub queue", "Nurse:  This goes over how to do that", "Nurse:  But you know people forget that you know it doesn't matter how thin or how heavy you are", "Nurse:  We all have a big surface area here so you just need to make sure you rotate all over", "Nurse:  We tell people if you take your belly button", "Nurse:  Make a little square around your belly button just stay away from your belly button because it's sensitive but otherwise use the whole surface of your tummy okay so this will be your goodies to take home", "Nurse:  And we will do that so you're on your way home after here", "Patient: Yeah I'll stop by and drop the stuff off", "Nurse: Cause you want to make sure that these get in the fridge", "Nurse: Not your metformin but the Victoza", "Patient: Alright so we", "Nurse: Any questions anything you can think of about your medicine anything you have concerns about", "Patient: Not really", "Nurse: I think you're going to do great I will call you like I said weekly for the next few weeks as your building I want to see how you're doing and and", "Nurse:  You know if you have any problems in between though you call me especially if you have any severe side effects you're like what's going on I don't like this is this from this medicine me call me and we can discuss what's going on and see if it is", "Nurse:  I don't want you hanging out there feeling like crap if it's something that can", "Nurse:  Okay that's interesting", "Patient: They're certainly not needed in the field anymore", "Nurse: Not interesting but they're a major supplier", "Patient: Yeah well they found out another suppliers having problems too", "Patient:  Apparently they're having a similar problem", "Patient:  Who would've thought that blowing something up would cause people to get hit with shrapnel", "Patient:  What are the odds", "Nurse: It's like this thing that supposed to save people's lives are killing people", "Nurse:  That's scary", "Patient: My kids they're always screwing around in the car its like no you don't want to drive in the car with your head like that in an accident the airbag will break your neck and that's why I apparently the teach kids now you don't drive at the 10 and two position where is my buddy used to say the 9 and 5 it's just like that's where you drive but the rest of us are here now so you don't break your arms on the airbags", "Nurse: It's like technology you have to keep changing everything I think it's is your daughter driving yet", "Patient: No she could be but it's a great steak and she's not very cooperative and doesn't seem to care so there we go all those together save us the money I don't know if we could afford it anyways", "Patient:  It's like 2 and a half thousand for insurance I think ", "Nurse: I get it but holy smokes it's ridiculously expensive", "Nurse: I'm going to go back and I'm going to get your coffee ready cuz I'm going to get ready to draw your last set do you like anything in your coffee", "Patient: Coffee just a little bit of water to smooth it out a bit so it's not so grainy", "Patient:  Dollar 49", "Patient:  Mascara from Maybelline at CVS $2 off one printable right there", "Patient:  What do you want on the portal bunch of makeup without asking me because you wanted to spend more money so I can buy your stuff", "Patient:  Have you taught her she should", "Patient:  No well you know that only they know everything but they also know that they", "Patient:  I'll be back with black coffee", "Patient:  At last blood draw", "Patient:  Coffee smells yummy rubber smell", "Patient:  I hope that for me", "Patient:  Trying to do something", "Nurse: Knowing that Mom and Dad hey isn't the revolving Bank", "Patient: Isn't aware of that yet", "Patient:  I think she just thinks that this gets her a second thing", "Patient:  Thank you", "Nurse: You are so welcome", "Nurse: Let me go run this to the lab and then when I get back we're going to do your last injections", "Nurse:  Okay", "Nurse:  Excited", "Patient: I am alive", "Patient:  Finally", "Patient:  The service at this place stinks", "Patient:  I asked for this 3 hrs ago", "Patient:  There are restaurant like that too", "Patient:  Oh yeah I'll get you your coffee you can bring it to my house cuz I'm leaving now", "Nurse: Is your coffee gone yet? Alright so first go to the first thing that you see the little dots dial to the little dots that you see", "Patient: Go just a little bit yep", "Nurse: Just when you start a new pen not every injection you're going to dial it to that take your cap off and shoot it in the air", "Nurse: Perfect as long as you see something come out your pen is primed and ready to go now it should go back to zero and you're going to dial it 0", "Nurse: 6", "Nurse: Find any spot on your tummy go straight in push and don't pull it out immediately count to ten and then pull it", "Nurse:  That's all you have to do", "Nurse: If you see that it drips a lot keep it in there few more seconds okay so put that one back on", "Nurse: Yep you're just going the wrong way", "Patient: Oh okay", "Nurse: And should be back to zero and everything's good what do you think seriously did you actually feel the needle", "Nurse:  Cause some people don't", "Patient: Tiny bit", "Patient:  Last time I checked here I didn't", "Patient:  This time I felt it a little bit", "Nurse: And maybe because this time you got a little bit of medicine but that is it in this is how you store your pen in between injections okay", "Nurse: So this one I will leave out so you know you don't have to put this one in the fridge put all the boxes in the fridge when you get home", "Nurse: I will check with you next week and see how you're

like", "Nurse:  Oh my God it was the worst headache they ever had", "Nurse:  And", "Nurse:  McKinley cause stomach discomfort and diarrhea I have not had any of that reported but I think stomach", "Nurse:  Discomfort and diarrhea I think is associated with any possible medication", "Nurse:  Let's see anything else you know anything severe allergic reaction have never seen any of that but again anybody can have an allergic reaction to anything so it's the typical swelling of your face lips throat please let us know ASAP after you're being treated", "Nurse:  That's what's so nice as medication is so easy if you skip a dose of you you know end up going to work and you realized you forgot it it's alright just wait till the next day", "Nurse:  And what's nice is she is just a small little pill on your big question one of those people you take them all at once", "Nurse:  You know they don't ever want you to double up on this medication really much of any medication but that's that it does come in lower doses but that's only if we see down the road like", "Nurse:  Somebody who ends up their kidney start getting really bad", "Nurse:  That we can give him a lower dose okay but I have not had to do that either can be taken with or without food like I said most people just get up and take it and go about their day", "Nurse:  What was the other thing I was thinking I was just on the tip of my tongue", "Nurse:  Oh yes so Sitagliptin may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis so I know if you've ever heard of pancreatitis it's inflammation of your pancreas pancreas is what produces urine", "Nurse:  You will know", "Nurse:  Because it's severe abdominal pain again I've not seen it with this medication and anybody that we've done here or in the other places I've worked but I guess it has been reported at some time during all this research again it is severe abdominal pain if you ever have any severe severe abdominal pain you need to go to the ER", "Nurse:  Does pancreatitis is could be life threatening", "Nurse:  Okay it's like so simple and people are doing really well", "Nurse:  You just continue to do your diet and stay active and this medication works really well okay", "Nurse:  That's really at this is just more information on another level he already got venue metformin so it's not new", "Nurse:  Again low blood sugar soda so it's nice", "Nurse:  It's a very neutral medication and it works", "Nurse:  When your body needs it if that makes sense so that's why yes it says on here symptoms of a low blood sugar but this medication isn't known to do that because how it works is as you're eating", "Nurse:  If your body needs more insulin it tells it to produce more you know helps to produce more insulin so it's like on demand", "Nurse:  So that's what's really nice is it's not like okay here it is in your body it's giving you all this medicine and I will send it doesn't do that so that's really nice have you ever had a low blood sugar before", "Nurse:  Or you can hear it called Sitagliptin but one bottle has only 30 tablets 90 so you'll come back and see me about 90 days", "Nurse:  But she's a pretty little not bad from this out because it's soon as we settle", "Nurse:  Alright so in here is some more information so this you can always keep handy if you want has all of our information on it that's so does this card so a lot of people put this in their wallet cuz it tells anybody that you're on Metformin and the new Januvia", "Nurse:  CamelBak you always have our phone number so no matter where you are you can always call me", "Patient: I'm sure I have but I don't get them very often usually it's like I don't", "Nurse: Pretty much with anybody with a hip diabetes or not a long time without food your body saying hello I need fuel and you kind of get those same old symptoms you know shaky and sweaty and oh my gosh I'm starving I need to eat now", "Nurse:  I don't suspect that you're going to have any of those problems okay", "Nurse:  Anything you can think of", "Patient: Dentist", "Nurse: Whatever's going to work for you to take it during the day or first thing in the morning if it's going to work the best for you and for anybody and you know you already check your blood sugar so keep doing that do you have to your insurance covers your test strips and all that good stuff", "Patient: Ipw a credit card that they put money on a big head like Flex Spending kind of insurance doesn't cover what I need to do is just so crazy to me but I have them by two different like injection they gave me a bunch of blankets for so I been using that one and I just have to meters", "Nurse: And it's sad when you think not many insurances pay for it diabetics have to have them and seriously some of them are like a dollar a strip if you break it down", "Patient: Or if I get a Walgreens there $45 for 25 sorry for that I have to go to Walmart because there that's cheap as it has the cheaper test strips when I was like well maybe I should get that but then I was like I have this so I just pick them up in the longest time I couldn't get anywhere except Walgreens right it's almost $2", "Patient:  yeah they have a hundred like the inner one for like 88 I'm sorry that really blows my mind", "Nurse: That's just amazing but yeah I mean Just for information down the road if if price is becomes an issue at any point", "Nurse:  The meters are the cheaper part you can get a meter for like ten bucks and then they're so because you're not on insulin you're not your diabetes you know", "Nurse:  My gosh we need to know exactly accurate when you can easily switch to that cheap or meter if that's ends up saving you money down the road because it's not going to be that off for what information you need right now", "Nurse:  So just so you know yes one touch is a really really good meter and if for people that we", "Nurse:  Define insulin several times a day and they take their insulin based on that value yes we needed to be super super accurate could yours be you know ten points off it's not going to be life-threatening for you so you could easily switch", "Patient: Yeah I will see what I have and then he and then think about it", "Nurse: I know that a real common one that is at", "Nurse:  Walmart that we used to tell people about is called a ReliOn media interesting is that one is made by Novo Nordisk which is a big insulin company so it is not a bad meter", "Patient: Walmart", "Patient:  I have to act like I'm not paying an extra $10 I know you're really the only thing", "Patient:  Okay so just under $200 per year", "Patient:  Well I just raise my primary $600", "Patient:  We'll see how it all they have a lot of programs for free ideas", "Patient:  So interesting it is and I know beyond limits on front headlights", "Patient:  Duramax", "Patient:  My insurance covers is my", "Patient:  If I wanted to get like I'm the one that's that

Walmart", "Nurse:  You know their insurance change and all the sudden it's like it wasn't our preferred drug anymore", "Nurse:  So it was costing people going to cost people at $700 every 3 months", "Nurse:  That's", "Nurse:  They have very limited income you have and it's like oh yeah there's going to have $700 every 3 months 241 Medicare", "Nurse:  Hurt get to take this off no absolutely not I know placement form in except the one you're on extended release is a free drug at", "Patient: Okay", "Nurse: It's always one thing or another", "Patient: Department of Finance", "Nurse: Very

getting late", "Nurse: Yep are you more of a night owl", "Patient: Well no I just saying earlier being up a couple hours I start to get sleepy and that last much of the day and then at 5 o'clock or so

came it to research", "Nurse:  I'm going to do some measurements of your chest with something that's called a heartsquare", "Nurse: Something recent something research yeah I mean like I said",

as you can think of as fast as you can that begin with that letter there only two exceptions first you may not say the names of people and places so if I were to say t you could say words like table take or turtle", "Nurse:  But cannot say words like Thomas or Texas", "Nurse:  The second exception is that you may not say the same word with a different ending for example if you say take then you could not say takes or take it it's really the same word with different endings", "Nurse:  Tell me as many words as quickly as you can that begin with the letter F I will tell you when to stop go as

the bottom are empty", "Nurse:  I want you to put in each of the empty squares the mark that should go in there like this here is a two and this symbol I'm doing it upside down", "Nurse:  Paris A1",

all done with that i'm going to do your last blood draw on the and the ogtt while we're in our window here", "Nurse: It's funny when you like I know it's funny though when you do that yeah it sounds easy but then when you're put under pressure", "Nurse: Flush that and then we're done with the ogt and then your meds should be along soon and we'll do you want some coffee or something", "Nurse: I think the cat", "Nurse: Did you park downstairs in the garage downstairs", "Patient: You mean across the street at MGX?", "Nurse: I'll check on meds and I'll get", "Nurse:  you your parking and I'll

supposed to be mailed with it but then it said completed by clinic staff only", "Nurse: Oh the sample sample they", "Nurse: So this goes with the samples and this completed by them", "Nurse: Did you already send a sample", "Nurse:  So when you send it just send this with and then is this the barcode sticker", "Nurse:  And then did you do the", "Nurse: Send them in so yeah you can do it yet cuz usually want you to do as soon as you're as close to as when you're selling the sample so you can fill those out and then you still have the envelope and stuff I gave you", "Nurse:  Send the sample to a different place than you sned the questionarre", "Nurse:  So you can send them back you don't have to worry about finishing them today or you could drop them off like whatever is yeah whatever is easier", "Nurse: If you want to take a little walk during lunch or do you even get a lunch I mean I remember when I was on the floor ", "Patient: That's why I have such bad habits eating habits", "Nurse: Do they give you guys like a half hour break over there do you get it", "Patient: I average a little less than 10 minutes and I probably go less than 70% of the time cuz I'm only there 8 hours a day", "Nurse: You just keep working the whole way through", "Patient: I mean it won't that's when I am in a locker room that's when I have a drink", "Patient:  So I'm drinking a diet coke or whatever else I have", "Patient:  I bring all kinds of crap to drink gatorade, diet coke, green tea", "Patient:  I usally eat on the way", "Patient:  I'll eat something like", "Patient:  I'll bring peanute butter and jelly and I'll make two sandwiches and eat one on the way in and then if I get to it lunch fine and if not I'll eat it on the way home", "Nurse: It's hard when you have to eat on the fly like that it definitely takes planning and packing", "Nurse: So I have all of your supplies so we're going to talk about the medication", "Nurse:  I have more metformin for you", "Nurse:  Two bottles", "Nurse:  And then three bottles of glimepiride they are 2 milligram", "Nurse:  Oh this one's four the others are two", "Nurse:  So we're starting you on one mg today so you're going to split the tablet is really easy to split it it's pretty much already perforated so just make sure you're using the two mg and not the 4", "Nurse:  To start with", "Nurse:  Now as trying this time of day you take it", "Nurse:  I have people that take it in the morning people who take it at night it kind of depends do you tend to eat dinner late what's your usual schedule or do you eat dinner at would you say more of a normal time", "Patient: The line just mainly eat probably between 5 and 7", "Nurse: 5 and 7 at night", "Nurse:  Okay and that's your dinner and you don't really eat again till the morning", "Patient: Unless you have a snack", "Nurse: So you're not eating dinner at like 9 o'clock at night", "Nurse:  Okay so why don't we start in the morning and see how it goes sometimes people do better if he can get at night cuz I tend to like you know people work crazy hours and they work late they get home like to eat late so the next morning their fasting blood sugar so high because they have dinner at 10 o'clock", "Nurse: So I think you'll be fine taking in the morning", "Nurse: So you'll split it one tablet in the morning", "Nurse:  Take it at about the same time", "Nurse:  If you forget don't double up", "Nurse:   I'm guessing we'll probably have to agree to one milligram is really a small dose but we like to start it at that because of the potential side effects of hypoglycemia", "Nurse:  We just don't want to start anyone off with a dose that's too high", "Nurse:  I am providing you with a study meter", "Nurse:  So you will be using that 3 bottles of strips", "Nurse:  150 strep so it should last until your next visit if you ever running out of supplies just let me know I can always mail them to you you can stop by after work whatever is easier here he's a really good for people", "Nurse:  These are really good for people with diabetes they are called diabetes extend bars", "Nurse:  They're kind of granola bar but the person that the doctor that formulated it didn't like her own kitchen cuz she had children with diabetes so it's made with them cornstarch instead of like flour something supposed to be released slower into your system so you avoid that Spike", "Nurse:  Some people like them some people don't you can let me know if you like him and I'll continue to give them to you if not I will stop", "Nurse:  But yeah a little snack and some glucose tabs because being on glimepiride you should have them around", "Nurse:  The good thing about these is they never melt they don't really go bad you can put them in the car they last forever", "Nurse:  So that's everything we'll be giving you today we can talk about the glimepiride", "Patient: How often do you want me checking blood sugar", "Nurse: Every morning", "Nurse: Fasting before you have coffee cuz coffee infections so just only water and then after you check you'll have breakfast and stuff and then if we're having trouble trying to figure out what your best dose sometimes I'll have people check mid-day cuz I'm curious what your blood sugar is doing then some people' will wake up with a high fasting but then midday they're like 90", "Nurse:  So this tells us that the glimepiride is working but these are usally the people who eat late at night", "Nurse:  So their fasting blood sugar isn't really a fasting blood sugar", "Nurse:  So in situations like that sometimes I ask people for a couple of weeks to check midday so I have a better idea of what dose to put you on", "Nurse:  Cause I don't want to put you on something too high and then your fasting is like 150 than midday your 60 and you don't know it you know I don't I don't want that", "Nurse:  So that's going to be the plan", "Nurse:  So that's just information not too much information we're going to go over an informational handout about glimepiride", "Nurse:  So we kind of already talked about", "Nurse:  The two biggest side effects is hypoglycemia and weight gain so what does glimepiride do it lowers blood sugar levels basically what it does is it causes your pancreas to push out more insulin", "Nurse:  It stimulates that don't crush or chew the pill take it once a day", "Nurse:  Usually in the morning but like I said some people it works better for them at night we'll figure that out", "Nurse:  Start you off on 1mg and then the highest amount you'll ever be on the study would be 8mg", "Nurse:  So start off at 1 I'm guessing we will increase you to two pretty soon pretty quickly cuz most people one doesn't do much of anything but we'll see once you get up to 4mg a day I have take two in the morning and two night", "Nurse:  And then if we're up to eigh it would be like 4 in the morning and 4 at night but we'll we can cross that bridge when we get there if you forget to take it do not double up on it because that will cause more insulin yeah and then you can low blood sugar", "Nurse:  If you take that leads if you take too much you could hypoglycemia so if that ever happens I had one patient one time that he", "Nurse:  He took it and he forgot he took it again so overnight he had low blood sugar so we're going to go over the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar again if that ever happens you know check a couple extra times during the night just to monitor that just to make sure you're blood sugar is not going too low", "Nurse:  Have you ever had a low blood sugar", "Nurse: We're going to talk about low blood sugar and then I'll continue on this", "Nurse:  So this is a little handout about hypoglycemia", "Nurse:  Low blood sugar is defined as any blood sugar less than 70", "Nurse:  Common symptoms of low blood sugar are usually a feeling of hunger, sweaty clammy, shakey, weak, confusion you just feel kind of off something doesn't feel right", "Nurse:  The most common some peopl have their own thing some people have vision changes but that is severe", "Nurse:  Or some people's tongue goes numb", "Nurse:  But we don't want you to have those symptoms", "Nurse:  And once you have it once, you know I\"m hoping you don't, but you might, you'll know what it feels like", "Nurse:  And it's kind of like you know and then if you ever have any symptoms even if your wrong I'd rather have you check", "Nurse:  If you ever feel off or something doesn't feel right even if you're a little nauseous or something just check your blood sugar", "Nurse:  So that's another thing you should always have with you is your meter now", "Nurse:  Just cause you're on the glimepiride and like I said once we get  you a little more comfortable into the dose we're going to have you on it won't be imperative to have it on you every second of every day because we'll be more consistent", "Nurse:  But in the beginning just for safety", "Nurse:  This is kind of going over everything we talked about what causes low blood sugar low insulin I mean this is all stuff you know already", "Nurse:  What do you do if you're having a low blood sugar? So if you are having a low blood sugar  you can take these glucose tabs that I gave you yep so you want to take more than one cuz one only has 4 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates when you have a blood sugar of 70 or below", "Nurse:  You want to treat with 15 grams of fast-acting carbs that's kind of the rule", "Nurse:  It's called the 1515 rule so you check your blood sugar say it's 60", "Nurse:  You want to treat with 15 grams of fast acting sugar so that would be three or four of these I think 4 would be 12", "Nurse:  4 would be 16 three would be 12 so depending on how low you are", "Nurse:  You wait 15 minutes and you check again if it's above 70 that means your blood sugars on the way up that's fine if it's still low 15 more wait 15 minutes check again", "Nurse:  If you do not have glucose tabs with you orange juice apple juice the thing is you want to remember it 15 grams so like 8 oz of apple juice is going to be 30 grams it's going to be double your dose so you want to do like 4oz of apple juice 4oz is pretty small you don't need a lot", "Nurse:  A lot of people you know A cuz it's scary to have low blood  sugar people tend to overdo it and then you go the other way and you're high so 4 oz of juice works really quickly", "Nurse:  I recommend apple juice over orange orange juice works too but", "Nurse:  When you're not feeling so good with a low blood sugar in orange juice kind of acidic and pulpy it's just not something apple juice is very smooth very sugary and works really well you could even like you could drink it warm and it won't taste disgusting wher orange juice is gross if it's warm", "Nurse:  Some people keep little juice boxes like the little ones because that's the serving size like around if they need it", "Nurse:  You can find out what you prefer this is kind of a list of more of the symptoms that we went over mild headache they categorize it into mild Moderate and severe so the mild would be like", "Nurse:  Headache shaking hunger getting worse severe that would be where you need emergency treatment", "Nurse:  Did you say your wife is a nurse to okay so that's good so she'll kind of", "Nurse:  I'm sure she's familiar with the basics of hypoglycemia treatment so that that", "Nurse:  will be good too", "Nurse:  We talked about treating a low the 1515 will glucose Tabs are great they are my favorite thing for that cuz they never go bad you can put them in your car and it could be like 200 degrees out they're still fine", "Nurse: Usually we don't for treating a low a lot of people are like yeah I'll have some chocolate or ice cream and I'm like yeah that'll bring up your blood sugar but not right away because it has a bunch of fat in it", "Nurse:  You don't want to eat something with a bunch of fat in it because the fat takes long time to be absorbed into your bloodstream so", "Nurse:  Maybe half hour lateer it'll bring up yourr blood sugar but not right away so you want to go for those fast-acting sugars", "Nurse:  Oh this talks about Nighttime hypoglycemia glimepiride I mean if your insulin that's more of a thing than being on glimepiride especially if you take it in the morning at night it could happen I mean pretty rare", "Nurse:  If you are fearful of having a little blood sugar over night you could check test your blood sugar before you go to bed see what it is if it's on the lower side say 80 that's when you'd have  like a snack with fat in it peanut butter, crackers nuts because the fat gets absorbed slowly so it kind of keeps you steady overnight", "Nurse:  So if that's something you know that you're concerned about that's the best recommendation like don't eat a lot of sugar, fast acting sugar at that time would just spike your blood sugar and you'd probably wake up with a high blood sugar", "Nurse:  Something with some fat in it I always eat peanut butter and crakers because those work really well", "Nurse:  And then just the difference between low blood sugar and high blood sugar", "Nurse:  There are ifferent symptoms for each sometimes they they can be similar so if you that's why if you are having symptoms it's good to check and not just assume your low you could be high", "Nurse:  So that's kind of and overview of hypoglycemia", "Nurse:  If you ever have any questions  feel free to call me or shoot me an email", "Nurse:  I'm happy to help with anything", "Nurse:  We talked about side effects", "Nurse:  Those are kind of the plan you're on glimepiride for the grade study", "Nurse:  So your A1C was 7 point I know it wasn't above 8 so we're going to start you on 1mg today if it was above 8 we would start you on 2 we're going to start you on 1 we're going to have you on 1mg for a week and I'm just going to have you I'll probably call you next week see what your fasting blood sugars have been and if they're consistantly over 100 120 I'll put you up to 2mg", "Nurse:  Do that for two weeks until we get you in a better blood sugar range", "Nurse:  And then we'll leave you be for awhile", "Nurse:  And then that's the thing about diabetes and medication", "Nurse:  Your body changes, your life changes, stress changes so there might be times when we need to increase it or there might be times when we need to decrease it", "Nurse:  It's really common", "Nurse:  There's a log here you can use this if you'd like or your own log", "Nurse:  I can make some more copies of this if you want to use this", "Nurse:  Just like some people download apps on their phone and put it in their phone", "Nurse:  So how are you feeling about the glimepiride? Do you have any questions?", "Patient: Nothing we have an answer that I don't think", "Nurse: So we're going to have you take your first dose today so you'll take half of one of these I can get you some water if you'd like and then I know you didn't take your metformin this morning but maybe wait until you've had some lunch I don't want you to make your stomach upset", "Nurse: Next visit will be in about three months that'll be your first quarterly visit it'll be quick like a half hour 45 minutes", "Nurse: Is it did you want to call me to schedule it or do you know your work schedule", "Patient: Yeah I never know my schedule", "Nurse: Visit is complete current local time is 11:48 in the morning"], "labels": ["NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA",

go to work", "Patient:  Okay schedule me for like in the morning", "Patient:  I think how whole it took me 4 hours to get here so it took me what I said", "Patient:  Doctor's appointment in the morning", "Patient:  Oh how awful that's just brutal Army are Morningstar", "Patient:  Yeah I mean face that they don't know where I was they didn't know where I was at this schedule meeting",

just every winter comes with a B dry skin", "Nurse: What do you use for a 220 motion on Earth", "Patient: \"Minecraft out of my wife, I have this thing\"", "Nurse: You know your people who are really prone to dry itchy skin doing a daily this is just the alcohol to help some things stick a little daily moisture", "Patient: There's always haven't seen that part of the money and you know", "Nurse: Even though you are a buffet relatively young person", "Nurse:  You know people with diabetes we worry about the legs in the feet because you know anybody the blood flow Downstream is not as good as it is upgrade", "Nurse:  And the risk of infection when you get a cut is goes out so and so to prevent hats if you're prone to really dry skin get smegma", "Nurse:  Doing a daily moisturizer rubbing some", "Nurse:  Generic lotion if you have real sensitive begins things like Cetaphil is pretty good I'm going to lift your shirt up so forgive my give my grab and I'm also going to", "Nurse:  And to getting general in general", "Patient: This is again", "Nurse: Some of that rubbing alcohol cuz it really helps the leads to stick", "Patient: Will tell you that we spent seemingly hours just working today", "Nurse: At the Celtics seconds because getting and I'm going to take some measurements this is a little bit unusual for an EKG to do this but we do it so I know and I'm thinking 17 for the Eastpointe", "Patient: Find RV for sale", "Nurse: 17 + 15 17 and 15 we both have to work on remembering those two numbers", "Nurse: Okay if that helps you remember", "Patient: 5917 I need to remember where she needs work", "Nurse: Directions 17th", "Patient: So my son is 16 so is the one number two", "Nurse: We got this", "Patient: Arnel still getting an angle of course here", "Nurse: I guess I

know that's not", "Patient: Have you had the patience say that do you know when they take a full dose of Metformin face you like code", "Nurse: I'm not heard that", "Patient: You mean like I like chill or what", "Nurse: I have not heard that", "Nurse: When did you start noticing it", "Patient: I start taking the full dose if it's later probably also because I'm", "Nurse: That is probably unless I need that would make sense if you're not generating as much as so good I'd hate to have you back down on the metformin dose so I think would LOL", "Patient: That's what my dad", "Patient:  You know what you think when you came over somebody your dad said now okay two more hours", "Nurse: The Harry fellows really really don't like us", "Nurse: The stuff out of the way so we don't create a trip Hazard I see you're taking that I'm taking this just to have", "Patient: Is every day every week every winter when I start the heat in the house is just dry", "Nurse: Okay have a seat check the time and price we got 10 minutes for your next letter we're doing great I can't do this I will let you do that alright good to see you", "Patient: Okay", "Nurse: It's all yours okay thank you YouTube

just", "Patient:  I'm so beat that sampled", "Patient:  Flip", "Patient:  I don't like those sleeves at all but it was a pleasure today", "Nurse: The lab right now and because I know how much you love filling up for you know I said I would I remember I sent you home with a bunch of forms and some of them were related to the microbiome did you bring them back don't worry she don't know that I don't want you to refill anything else these are not microbiome forms these are just some of the surveys that I didn't have you do last time so I'm going to have you do them today though", "Nurse: And that long they're not too personal there", "Patient: Alright I'll be back in a bit", "Patient:  Other type of PhD", "Patient:  Getting them standardized", "Patient:  Getting really close to being done to then we'll do that", "Nurse: Are those fun", "Patient: Yeah", "Nurse: Questions about it", "Patient: Hello good feeling well these are not as bad at all", "Nurse: You know a lot of people though get hung up in the interpreting and what does it take to ask you it doesn't matter just go with your gut react to it", "Nurse: Sadistic says we need to call them like statistics for grad school hurt me I can't hurt it I might get the wrong answer but never going to die", "Patient: So how's my sugar", "Nurse: We're going to do it at the end at the end I was 128 to start which is snow decent normal but certainly not the control that you've had lately", "Patient: And I think the synagogue of Satan", "Nurse: Assuming that you're tolerated our hope is that it's going to take you that 6", "Nurse: 9 and get into the most sixes are feeding into the fights we've had since we're done yeah the next next release the last one and so as soon as that's done we'll get you some coffee and then we'll spend a little bit of time again going over to Adams have you pick a dose and then you're done", "Patient: You're making good progress", "Nurse: Removing long and then you get to drive to Detroit", "Patient: I'll text you that talk my boss and I said you know I'm going to be in the hospital in the morning at my soul", "Patient:  Yes hello how are you I think she just walked out call Pat", "Nurse: Spend a little more time talking about the medication thank you for filling gel by the way the EKG looks perfectly normal perfectly normal", "Patient: That's it for a hotel heartbreak for the UK game", "Nurse: This is how you know your heart is a muscle that beats in a certain synchrony driven by electrical impulses this shows the electrical conduction through the heart and we look at it and yes we have these leads across your chest and on your list so it's really measuring", "Nurse:  The electrical I don't know if it's an impedance measure what exactly but it by looking from like point A to point B and point Cedar Point it's taking", "Nurse:  Sort of electrical snapshot of how the electricity the electrical parts of the heart", "Nurse:  So you know these lines down here the V4 V5 V6 are really looking at the side and back part of the heart", "Nurse:  B1 B2 and 3 is more looking at the surface part of the heart and then the limb help to do the cross sections to the diagonals through the", "Nurse:  Was just telling us that the impulse is traveling this is the one that I screwed up on", "Nurse: That you had her I noticed was this should be going up right and I looked at that going down but that's not right because I have the right not to let me fix that and then the one that we have is perfectly normal", "Nurse:  But what it shows us is", "Nurse:  That there's no the heart at rest and basically these spikes", "Nurse:  How much correspond to the contractions of the Heart Stopper and lower Chambers so the upper chamber fires a little bit and it's it's very subtle stopper chamber", "Nurse:  Exactly the repolarization and depolarization we ever Chambers contracts", "Nurse:  That helps to fill the lower chamber in the lower chamber them has a big contraction and then a relaxation face so what we look for at a minimum is", "Nurse:  Is the spacing between the Peaks pretty symmetrical and then in terms of conduction we look for there should be a little blip", "Nurse:  Big blimp and a little blood okay", "Nurse:  In the little they also all these measurements measure how long what's the time for these clips in between when the split started in the blood for technical terms the time between the blitz start in the bluefin", "Nurse:  That has to do with how quickly that impulses traveling down the electrical Pathways of the heart", "Nurse:  So if you have one of these this is called the QRS complex if this is really wide", "Nurse:  You like that it says that they're taking too much time for the electrical impulse to get through the heart muscle and as a result the heart is probably not beating very effectively instead of that nice quick contractions squeezes the blood out through", "Nurse:  So we look at those things we look at progression you know we expect certain patterns to appear V1 should be", "Nurse: We have these start these ones start down gradually get taller at V3 and they're almost as much below the line is above the line and by V6 they should be almost all about the look for things like that to tell us is the electricity passing through your heart in the right sequence and is expiring at the rice equipment is it doing so you know people who have afib hear a lot about that because there's a fib is when the top chamber of the heart is beating too fast so instead of this nice relaxed line in between the blood that's not good", "Patient: Thank you", "Nurse: I'm not going to give you this because you're not well just a suspect Lee reversal lateral infarct consider inferior team that's that's all saying that you're having a heart attack", "Nurse:  This man has not had a heart attack I know I know this to be true", "Patient: We got about 10 minutes nothing different there", "Nurse: Actually the same and it's there's 200 tablets for giving you a total of 400 tablets but still 500 mg tablets with your evening I just got to take it with food", "Nurse:  There's two bottles in here one bottle has 90 tablets and one bottle has 30 tablets and we give you both just in case you know if we don't see you in a hundred days", "Nurse:  So it's a little round pills for this peachy salmon pale salmon color is pretty small the other bottle is just a 30 mg tablet", "Nurse:  It looks like that easy to swallow again no worries about whether you take it with food or on an empty stomach the most important thing is that you can take", "Nurse:  Most important things always take it at a consistent time of the day you know and buy consistent within an hour or so at the same time everyday and Jen just once a day", "Nurse:  I feel said I'll let you guys know let us know let us know as soon as I get done I'm going to Mountain roast and do take anything in it", "Nurse:  Cuz that would help to reduce stomach upset", "Patient: No I had drinks with straight straight up", "Nurse: If you want I can bring over bars in so we'll just get you some coffee and then we're going to do today is schedule your next appointment and we'll put that on my calendar so it'll be some afternoon Lynn is going to call you in 10 day sir so it's so we don't hear from you expect that will reach out to you is email best or is", "Patient: That's because I'm just so we'll see", "Nurse: Show me choke by email you know sum'n everything is good if if you have any questions concerns you call any of us or email any of us if everything's going to watch show plan to touch base in a couple weeks just to see how things are going and then I will see you in 3 months and will recheck your A1C at that point so it'll be a short visit and we'll do that out of Kellogg's so I'm going to go and do watch what am I going to do leave that they're going to make sure we have the coffee pot warmed up and ready for me to make you a big serving and then I'm going to come back and drive your last blood will get that thing out of your armwhat else feels like funny", "Patient: If you really would have happened there yesterday yeah I know I I thought you were going to be there today so I was pleasantly surprised to see you this morning", "Nurse: Okay let's go ahead and pick a date it's coming February and I can really do the only days I want to stay away from because we have to send things out the FedEx we should probably stay away from Friday's okay but any preferences", "Patient: Skillet properties late afternoon 5 so Monday", "Nurse: What do we can do Monday the 13th or Monday the 20th the 20th is President's Day I don't know if you have any holiday travel plans", "Patient: Yeah that's cool", "Nurse: And will do 5", "Patient: Let me as well", "Nurse: And again that's it's a very easy visit there's always going to be forms to fill out because because there are and and then that will get you one one blood draw and fresh Supply medication", "Patient: What's on my other calendar to sew", "Nurse: Coughing will do your last blood draw you can drink the coffee", "Patient: I don't spill it in like a flood", "Nurse: Yay over there so I'm going to get worse going to send you home with this folder that has the printed information about the meds and", "Patient: Yeah for my spare time reading right", "Nurse: We want you to feel comfortable if you have any questions or concerns address those needs crying", "Patient: How we draw", "Nurse: The amount of blood we're going today is really small you know we get it frequently in the Border you shouldn't notice any ill effects on your arm may feel a little sore from the line but that should ease pretty quickly", "Nurse: If it does feel sore you can put a warm compress on it", "Patient: Are you sure I haven't had any problems I haven't had a problem with it", "Nurse: You know it's because it's been in there for a while couple of hours sometimes a little more the worst part is going to be taking the take off it better to have it well taped then to have it falling out in Mestre poking you a lot of tape is better than", "Patient: Also the needles the needle was flexible", "Nurse: Yeah well you suck there's a metal inserter and then we pull the metal out much more comfortable than the old school never have you just help direct pressure right on the center I'll be right back I'm going to have you hold that till I get back", "Patient: Okay so", "Nurse: 285", "Nurse: Really a big jump from 128 before", "Nurse:  Air to 85 now and that's that's not that for that load of glucose I mean that that number while a little scary sounding is not is not terrifically uncommon are you going to see when you take this dressing up and you can take it off and then a couple of hours in 30 minutes don't be a little dry blood gently wash it if you do notice any swelling or bleeding just by direct pressure I like to have people hold pressure on it for a while so 285 let me take this to the", "Patient: What does that mean slime responsive", "Nurse: What it means is that in a perfect world without diabetes", "Nurse:  If somebody without diabetes we give that glucose low to their blood sugar will stay where it started pretty much it may go up to about 1:40 but then it'll come back down because the pancreas is able to rally and produce enough insulin to do that", "Nurse:  Your pancreas apparently is not keeping the pace you have diabetes so so the medication is when the blood sugar is elevated it should send a signal to the pancreas to", "Nurse:  I'll make sure that you have all I have", "Nurse:  Produce some of his more insulin and it doesn't do that directly it does it by this glp-1 hormone that your body produces and this will make the glp-1 more", "Patient: So you go ahead and take that", "Nurse: Let some time anyways let me I want to hear this", "Nurse:  Coffee in your system", "Nurse: Any questions at this point", "Patient: Cuz I'm going to all turn the recorder off I think I understand what I mean at this point there is a lot of information", "Nurse: Descriptions so I think the main thing is to focus on right now are try to take it at a consistent time again today is going to be a little bit off because yeah you don't have to take it at this time every day just find a time that works well and and be on the lookout for any change the symptoms tell you about the pancreatitis we sort of scare people about it it is incredibly rare and it's still not clear if it's a medication affect or if it's just type 2 diabetes has a higher risk of it so but again if you have belly pains having trouble reach out to us as drugs go this is about as easy as it gets you know no monitoring there's no the side effect profile is pretty low the risk of low blood sugar is pretty low intensity weight neutral so doesn't tend to add you know", "Patient: I guess I'm kind of lucky you the study to", "Nurse: I think it's like you know I can't say because that's why we're doing the study but I'm I'm really pleased I think so much with the metformin and and and the diet changes you know this is maybe enough just to not get into that perfect range and the hope is not to let you know we get hung up on the numbers we can see which is important but the main thing is to we want you to feel good and hopefully by getting your blood sugar closer to normal that gives people more energy that helps with mood and", "Patient: Yeah that's why I have determined to to to to be involved in the study", "Nurse: Let me go ahead and do this test so I need to read this the visit is complete the current local time is 11:38 a", "Nurse: m"], "labels": ["NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA",

want to do it because I don't I don't want to mess up you know", "Nurse:  I want this to be only your Lancet device but if you kind of see if I squeeze my my my over and over and over and over again it will get kind of red there", "Nurse:  And then then I'll be able to get blood out of it so I thought you and it takes a little bit longer cuz you have to create and then bring this over and pull it up on the text read", "Nurse: You do this it's okay when you can use them but you just need to let me know because the blood that is the blood sugar that is in your interstitial space look like right underneath your skin is different than what you're taking directly out of your bloodstream", "Nurse:  So if if it's a fasting blood sugar which is what I'm going to ask you do this is okay to do this if you have the time to do it if it's been 8 hours since you've had something to eat for your vast", "Nurse:  Or like when you get off work sort of thing but if it's if it's right after a meal and your and you're going to check it like you know sometimes even just two hours even", "Nurse:  Hours after meal it still is not going to really be", "Nurse:  An effective way of evaluating your blood sugars so if you want to do it that's fine because all I'm really going to do is ask you to check the fasting blood sugars and then you know if it's before the meals or something like that so there are limitations to this and I just have to kind of know", "Nurse:  I'm talking to you on the phone different kind of factored into the equation and well and I just would rather just go ahead and get it over with cuz I'm always in a hurry", "Patient: Okay", "Nurse: And then you can always put in some more of you know lancets in this little pocket to keep you and then you can you can throw this away once you don't need this but here's a little cheat sheet okay I always like to put that in there for first timers", "Nurse:  Then in here in the box if you're like really computer-savvy that you can do all kinds of stuff with this thing that here's the old-fashioned diary I'm not going to make you take", "Nurse:  Write it down as long as you at you have your meter you can turn it on and then you can hit", "Nurse:  One of these buttons and I'll go into memory and it'll tell me what the sugars are because what I'm going to do is I will call you on the phone and I'm going to ask you to tell me what your bus shark is Ravenna based on that then we'll make a decision if we need to increase your meds starting you out on a tiny dose for starting around on", "Nurse:  Actually you need to pop them in half I gave you too much", "Nurse:  Most people do not end up on 1mg I mean really to know mg is a good starting dose but just to be on the safe side because you don't want I want you on the smallest dose that'll do the job and you shut", "Nurse:  Turn 25 today so you never know maybe just a half a pill is enough I don't know but these are nice A little bow tie", "Patient: And", "Nurse:

I'm getting ready to tell you that", "Nurse:  I have a low blood sugar in my side lesson 70 so why", "Nurse:  Steel shape", "Nurse:  And the reason why is that if your sugar if your body has gotten used to run a little bit High", "Nurse:  And then you bring it down in normal it's like somebody who stopping smoking you know it's a good thing they don't have nicotine but their body does not feel good for a little while and you may never feel what I just told you but I always like to tell people just in case you know you do feel", "Nurse:  I mean you've already time to start a coming down you haven't noticed any symptoms you know so cuz you were now just 124 but if you ever do get that and you check with your your meter and you're not technically allowed", "Nurse:  I still want you to have just a little bit of like you might want to have two of these instead of or before you know for Lifesavers instead of 8 because it sound like nicotine gum while you're training your body to feel normal at a normal blood sugar use my name", "Nurse:  I bet you just don't want to go crazy in the kitchen sink now if you truly do have a low which we're lacking a lot of these days here", "Nurse:  But I mean nobody has had problems with this because in this study cuz we have started solo and we've done a pretty good job educating it yeah yeah educating you guys about you know how things work and you know", "Nurse:  But if you ever do have a low there's there is a limit to how much", "Nurse:  Connecting to do with research but it's a nice box that the BD company makes and they would like you to verify their meter and they're there everything and of course you know me back cuz I'm going to give you whatever you need for your diabetes so you don't need to spend any money", "Nurse:  It's called hypoglycemia a limit to how much food you should take okay so if you're truly having a low blood sugar less than 70", "Nurse:  I don't care if you treated with a little bit more but then those two two glucose tabs but if you truly have a low you really need to make sure that you have 15 grams of sugar for 15 grams and that is they give you a lift", "Nurse:  If you want to diabetes forecast I leave that in there and these these don't go for your meter those are lancets that go to the meter that they want you to", "Nurse:  And if they do give you some free alcohol and they also give you these little tablets which", "Nurse:  Again it will if you want to use them you go out and get Walmart brand don't buy the decks for Grant they would like for you to buy these but don't buy this brand I mean it's so much cheaper at Walmart", "Nurse:  But on that you know if you if you feel a little shaky and you know when in doubt even if you don't have your meter when in doubt I'd rather you have some sugar you know", "Nurse:  I think Lifesavers taste better that you're these are a little bit chalky own these are orange too I know you ain't going", "Nurse:  So they come in different flavors they come in different flavors if you choose to do this but", "Nurse:  But it'll say in this book like six or seven Lifesavers equals three of these four of these you know and you may not need if you feel a little shaky and you check your sugar and it's like a hundred your life", "Patient: Of what we have to change", "Nurse: So it's Baystate Lifesavers", "Nurse:  But it does", "Nurse:  Moderate Lifesavers I also say 4 oz of regular soda is a regular soda for tsp sugar", "Nurse:  10 ounces of milk half a cup of any kind of juice okay so it's not much you have to think I mean it's not much but but and then if it's going to be greater than an hour to your next meal you need to have something else because you have just like remember I told you at the at the", "Nurse:  Well team did your initial run and visit but usually what we say is that you know we don't want you to have a whole lot of these quick-acting drug because it'll it make your sugar go straight up straight back down again", "Nurse:  Have something with protein at each meal so that your sugar goes down like this it doesn't go all the way", "Nurse:  I have something that's not quick-acting never about the glycemic index and how you're supposed to straight stay as low as you can as far left of that page you know what I'm talking about and okay you remember that you still have that", "Nurse: And so you know if you're if you're eating something that's like a hundred 100 is just straight sugar so you know that regular soda is going to be in the high nineties you know cuz it doesn't have any protein to slow absorption but that's a good thing you want to have", "Nurse:  Will slow the absorption so they're saying if you're trying to treat yourself for Aloe you want to have something that Dad acting quick so they're saying no ice cream", "Nurse:  No no chocolate okay and I say that in here too now there's a lot of information about taking an injection you know", "Nurse:  If somebody's on insulin and all that stuff and you don't have to worry about that I mean the most I'll give you another book If you ever take any of those meds you don't have to worry about", "Nurse:  So that you know most of the stuff that I've got some stuff about the plate method you know how we were talking about", "Nurse:  You know most of your most of your food should be vegetables and fruits in only important protein quarter quart of rice or potatoes whatever you're going to happen and so dance you know if you have any questions to most important things for you personally in this book but if you when you read this book if you have any questions at all", "Nurse:  That's the good thing about being in a study you", "Nurse:  Ask me a lot of doctors don't", "Nurse:  Have people that can really help you specialize diabetes and help people who have diabetes cuz there's a lot to diabetes having diabetes so if you ever have any questions about anything", "Nurse:  Because that's what I'm here for bring it up at the visit or whatever you you feel the need that you need to do", "Nurse:  You know what I mean it with your if you're under control and everything's going well you don't want to have that kind of stuff cuz it Go your blood sugar goes rude", "Nurse:  But it does come straight back down again and you crash and so if it's going to be greater than an hour till your next meal 45 minutes", "Nurse:  Then you need to have something that's going to kind of stick to your ribs I say like having a little bit of it that's why they have a peanut butter sandwich here okay peanut butter sandwich you know like an ounce of cheese you don't have to have much you know in a couple of crackers okay so and that's going to keep it", "Nurse:  Because Dad that that six oz of soda is not going to keep it up OK longer than an hour", "Nurse:  Okay all of this is said in here how long the same", "Nurse:  This thing right here while they're saying no ice cream same thing I just talk to you about you want to have something the things that it's slow absorption", "Nurse:  What you eat most of the time staying on that left side of the page is fiber fiber will keep your sugar down because it's so hard for your body to break through it that your sugar doesn't go up Viber", "Nurse:  And protein slow absorption most of the time that's what you want again when you're having a low you want it fast and there's a lot of sugar in chocolate and an ice cream but there's also a lot of fat", "Patient: Some point you think have to take the shots from you guys", "Nurse: That what we do is if your sugar is under control and that's why it's so important to get it down below 7 because", "Nurse:  I just don't know why I just seen of course that's the worst thing you could do is eat your children's candy for breakfast and then you know I'm coming in here and some trash in it", "Nurse:  I could do anything when I got here see you really do cry so you're going to take this home and all you're going to do is either crossed out", "Nurse:  I thought I crossed out supper first meal of the day", "Nurse:  So I want you to take it at supper with your stuff for metformin that's best time of the day", "Nurse:  In my opinion now if we have to give a whole bunch of Amaryl to you then I will give you to make it a little bit even though gave you some in the morning but I always load people up at night time because that's just the best that's quadrant of the day I think you need the most help", "Nurse:  And if we can get it lower than that that's fine too cuz of normal they're probably talking to him about 6", "Nurse: 5 or 6", "Nurse: 4 cuz he's right on that line that's him that's what we call him", "Nurse:  Cuz he didn't have full-blown diabetes yet but you know if he goes above that 6", "Nurse: 5 A1c", "Nurse:  They'll start talking to him about you know diabetes and so if we can get it to 6 because the normal A1C is 4 to 6 so if we can get it to 6", "Nurse:  That's fine and that's good and that's a goal right now our goal is just at least keep everybody below 7 but", "Nurse:  Is 5", "Nurse: 8 on insulin right now and he's he's doing a No Love No Love I mean we're doing great and and and they know low blood sugar so the best control that you can get someone under is", "Nurse:  That number when you don't have loves okay so it was some people are easier to control than others and so you know you know I'm kind of start getting there at your A1C and that you know below 7 if I go any further for some reason they just get Lowe's", "Nurse:  You don't think it's okay to have a low blood sugar every once in awhile", "Nurse:  But you don't want to have fun", "Nurse:  No because your brain is telling you it doesn't have enough sugar and you want to keep brain function okay that's probably had some sugar for breakfast I bet I started crashing when I came in here", "Nurse: You don't have to worry about the rest of this and then", "Nurse:  These are all the the side effects of Amaryl and it's also in your consent form that you signed the last time you came in you shouldn't Crush her to him because then they won't work right and a lot of times it's all the all the literature you'll see is once a day it's marketed for once a day but I'll tell you that after you", "Nurse:  Get up to a certain dose it it doesn't do well enough", "Nurse:  Queen always wants me to add at least a little at breakfast but I'm doing exactly what she wants me to do for now", "Nurse:  Kids maybe you will just have to take it once a day and you know really you know there's not that many side effects except for taking too much you know that's really that the one thing that that would that we worry", "Nurse:  And if you are going to you know have of a test where you", "Nurse:  Have to you know if I can give you a colonoscopy for example you need to get in touch with me because we'll all take your dose because your calories are going to be greatly affected so you know during like you with a procedure like that or do you have to have surgery or something like that so I'm kind of your person to call and if I don't know the answer dr", "Nurse: green knows it", "Nurse:  So I can always find out the answer but if you change your diet extremely and it's you know Thanksgiving week more and we just kinda shirts will be up a little bit more but if you're going to eat less then you need to call me and you need to let me know", "Nurse:  I was trying to think of a time that we do that we really don't except for having surgery okay so do you have any questions for", "Nurse: Okay and I'm just a phone call away just call me and and I've had people call me on the weekend and really and truly I'm okay with that I really am I would rather you no answer your questions", "Nurse:  And then you have you know you have the answers I do need to get well first let me just go and give you the", "Patient: I don't think I have any pictures of the weekend 12", "Nurse: You're going to go over that or not", "Nurse: Infini", "Nurse: I won't give you enough", "Nurse: I have there's a couple of things I haven't done yet I didn't get you weight and height and I didn't copy this

go ahead and sign sign here and then you don't need a date it because we probably won't ever use", "Patient: Okay", "Nurse: Telus go get your height height and weight", "Nurse: I'll be right back", "Nurse: That when you get your blood sugars in this is not a research thing this is just diabetes 101 class okay", "Nurse:  How to think what's going on in your body your sugar is up", "Nurse:  Your medicine is going to come help pull that surround your bloodstream into your muscles are into your cells to be used as energy", "Patient: But the other part of that is", "Nurse: It'll make you a more efficient machine and this is good because if it does", "Nurse:  If it doesn't float around in the bloodstream it's not hurting your eyes not hurting your kidneys or Y", "Nurse:  What part in your Oregon so that's a good thing but the kind of negative part to it you have to remember it you'll either use those calories as energy or you will store them as fat", "Nurse:  So when you're getting your sugar under control", "Nurse: Your body is more efficient and so it's going to store those calories", "Nurse: Doesn't really matter what medicine you take its anything if you're if you get your blood sugar under control because that's the way God made her body you know you eat sugar is in there you have enough insulin in your taste medicine to help your insulin bring it into your cells or going", "Nurse:  Be able to use it for energy or stored as fat for a rainy day", "Nurse:  And the problem is there is no such thing as a rainy day so you don't want to store it because we never have a rainy day", "Nurse:  Where we don't have any food any more food is everywhere and so you know I always like to tell people up front but that's just the way our bodies run and it's better to get your blood sugar under control and maybe gain a few pounds", "Nurse:  But you don't want it to go crazy that's another thing I learned when I was 22 years old first thing in this job and somebody got their blood sugar in a control came back 3 months later and they had gained 20 pounds", "Nurse: From that day on when I was 22 250 in January I have told everybody what I just told you cuz some things yeah", "Nurse:  I learn from my people I learn and then and it's very important to kind of let you guys know how your body is working so that if you feel that you're starting to gain weight", "Nurse:  You have no choice but to pull back on the food because we don't need as much food to survive the longer we go so we actually need more food less food as we grow older and", "Nurse:  That's hard to do because we're used to eating like we were when we were 20", "Nurse: Can your metabolic rate you know that just your engine runs more in general your metabolic rate runs more when you're younger then when you're older and you have we just don't need as many calories", "Nurse: Cancel that's why people tend to gain weight as we get older because we don't we don't hold back on the couch like I tell myself I don't need to be and I can't I cannot eat candy anymore", "Nurse:  Because you know what I'm just going to stop it you know I mean because my kids can eat it there is there be no eight-year-old Little Motors or just running routine eyes are all motor is slowing down", "Nurse:  What is your food out of clothes a little bit tighter just know that you're getting you need to pull

to give that to you because with some people if you know, it actually doesn't make them hot as hungry and so it kind of helps in that area", "Nurse: And you know, I obviously it helps lower some lower than some blood sugar", "Nurse:  But if you wanted to do that, you would be doing it off the study and you know, this is a long study", "Nurse: And so was she was just concerned", "Patient: Amaryl was

little bit more though", "Nurse:  So, you know", "Nurse:  You know on the lowest dose, that'll do the job though, because I don't want you to feel low blood sugar", "Nurse: but", "Nurse:  Wanted to you", "Nurse:  I mean, I eat you're your own person and you could go off and you could stay", "Nurse:  You know, I really just think that maybe if", "Nurse: Try that other family of meds that she

either stop the Amaryl or she would cut down on the a", "Nurse: m", "Nurse: If she were to try that family of meds and I still leave your shoes", "Patient: It was good", "Patient:  She said she likes Amaryl", "Nurse: since you're such a low dose", "Nurse: I really want to respect everybody and their needs because you know, it's just a really long time to ask somebody to do something if their primary care doctor feels like it's not the best thing for him", "Nurse:  So", "Nurse: I definitely want to respect her and what her thoughts are, you know?", "Nurse: Because it's all about you know,
