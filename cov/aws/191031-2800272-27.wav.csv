103,00:09:27,00:09:27,spk_0,No.
104,00:09:29,00:09:31,spk_0,"But you still carry, Like when you were on your, uh,"
105,00:09:32,00:09:39,spk_0,three hour hike through Central Park. You have something with you? Yes. Okay. I had a candy bar actually help the nut roll.

112,00:10:09,00:10:13,spk_0,"Well, when winter comes and you're done with the outside stuff, it's probably a good time."
113,00:10:14,00:10:19,spk_0,Makes them stop there. I want to get the Lantis unit numbers down cycles.
114,00:10:20,00:10:22,spk_0,"Now, with your news,"
115,00:10:23,00:10:30,spk_0,maybe I can stretch it instead of having one pen every seven days. Maybe it goes every 10 days.
116,00:10:32,00:10:34,spk_0,"Usually that happens with great loss. Yeah,"
117,00:10:36,00:10:39,spk_0,"unless you weigh the less insulin resistant you're in, the less medication you need,"
118,00:10:41,00:10:42,spk_0,it's possible. It's tough.
119,00:10:43,00:10:46,spk_0,People tell me they looks like I've lost weight.
120,00:10:46,00:10:52,spk_0,"But as you can tell, I haven't. But yeah, whatever. You lost Fat muscle. Yeah,"
121,00:10:53,00:10:58,spk_0,"weight on the scales. Not always the full story,"
122,00:10:59,00:10:59,spk_0,"but, uh,"
123,00:11:00,00:11:01,spk_0,diet wise.
124,00:11:03,00:11:09,spk_0,"You know, there's several things you can try, but you know the basics there, half your plate is veggies."
125,00:11:10,00:11:15,spk_0,"And then the quarter of your plate is your meat recorder Played is your complex carbohydrate, and if you can"
126,00:11:15,00:11:21,spk_0,substitute in more veggies. Sometimes you're more full and you don't have t toe.
127,00:11:22,00:11:25,spk_0,It's stuff that may raise your blood sugar.
128,00:11:25,00:11:29,spk_0,But we're going into that time of the year where it gets tough because you got
129,00:11:30,00:11:31,spk_0,going
130,00:11:31,00:11:38,spk_0,Thanksgiving that Christmas years. You have the the Christmas baking season where we have all kinds of crap in the house
131,00:11:40,00:11:41,spk_0,"and it just,"
132,00:11:43,00:11:45,spk_0,"you know, it's It's just, uh,"
133,00:11:46,00:11:48,spk_0,it's a discipline. It's just like I can't eat that crap.
134,00:11:50,00:11:53,spk_0,"Yeah, well, for me, it's like if I'm"
135,00:11:54,00:12:00,spk_0,"eating healthy for a while, I've lost the craving for it. But if somebody brings something, you're you're getting unexpected treat"
136,00:12:02,00:12:12,spk_0,"then that I'm fighting that craving again because now I get that taste in my mouth and in my mind, and then I'm more apt to Okay, I'll get back on the wagon tomorrow, I'll get back on the wagon. Tomorrow"
137,00:12:13,00:12:18,spk_0,"is all of a sudden. That was four weeks ago on the scales. Going like this, well,"
138,00:12:18,00:12:20,spk_0,that two things come to mind is
139,00:12:21,00:12:26,spk_0,"we're just We're just talking about this with my wife. Last night used to be on Thursdays,"
140,00:12:27,00:12:28,spk_0,Fridays. I think it's Fridays.
141,00:12:29,00:12:31,spk_0,Papa Murphy's would have the pizza sale.
142,00:12:32,00:12:32,spk_0,"Okay,"
143,00:12:33,00:12:34,spk_0,so we would
144,00:12:35,00:12:37,spk_0,historically pick up pizza from
145,00:12:38,00:12:39,spk_0,"that. Doesn't even sound good. No,"
146,00:12:40,00:12:43,spk_0,"we haven't had that for a pot. Well, over six weeks."
147,00:12:43,00:12:44,spk_0,Wow. Yeah.
148,00:12:45,00:12:46,spk_0,"Um,"
149,00:12:46,00:12:48,spk_0,Chinese doesn't sound good anymore.
150,00:12:49,00:12:50,spk_0,Those were both two
151,00:12:51,00:12:56,spk_0,meals that really not having with your blood sugars. Right? So those two things
152,00:12:57,00:13:04,spk_0,"pasta. On the other hand, my wife makes a dynamite chicken noodle soup with all kinds of noodles noodles in there."
153,00:13:04,00:13:07,spk_0,"In fact, we've had that this week, so,"
154,00:13:08,00:13:13,spk_0,"um, that's not good for me either. But but if you limit yourself,"
155,00:13:14,00:13:21,spk_0,"Yeah, I used to have, like, three bowls of that stuff. Now it's just a bowl. Yeah, but it's, you know, portion control is really"
156,00:13:22,00:13:32,spk_0,"key to weight loss. If you could just cut back or push yourself away from the table while you're still feeling like you want another serving, wait 15 minutes, and usually that"
157,00:13:32,00:13:33,spk_0,"eases off. Yeah,"
158,00:13:34,00:13:43,spk_0,"and it's just the discipline that you can push yourself away. Well, you're still feeling a little hungry and let your stomach catch up to your brain. Think we're good? Yeah,"
159,00:13:44,00:13:53,spk_0,"the thing. It's a bad habit, and it's it's something that I've told myself. Okay, today is Halloween, so I'll go the whole try to go the whole day without a cane. A mark,"
160,00:13:54,00:13:55,spk_0,"but it's Ah,"
161,00:13:57,00:13:58,spk_0,"at night,"
162,00:13:59,00:14:04,spk_0,"there's ice cream bars available that I find myself having one night,"
163,00:14:04,00:14:06,spk_0,and it's used Iranian o'clock at night.
164,00:14:07,00:14:10,spk_0,"I don't test any because I know it's gonna be high,"
165,00:14:11,00:14:13,spk_0,but you should test to see what it does. The
166,00:14:13,00:14:20,spk_0,"ice cream night versus nine ice cream night and or substitute yogurt and Berries. Um, knives is taken."
167,00:14:21,00:14:28,spk_0,"Better substitute for get that craving sugar would be some grapes. Yeah, I love grapes and I love apples"
168,00:14:29,00:14:32,spk_0,and just programmed myself to eat that stuff at night
169,00:14:33,00:14:40,spk_0,"Or start, you know, alternating ice cream, burn fruit, ice cream, bar food. And then they eventually cut back a little bit more."
170,00:14:41,00:14:44,spk_0,"They're all good strategies, and it's good that you know"
171,00:14:45,00:14:55,spk_0,"where your weaknesses are. Yep, and that you don't make a small change, something that you can live with. Anybody can lose weight on any diet because you're eating less."
172,00:14:57,00:15:06,spk_0,"It's the maintenance phase. After you get done, you know your weight loss you wanted and not falling back into the same old habits that got you where you work."
173,00:15:07,00:15:11,spk_0,"It's just, you know, kind of like a changing eating style. Don't take it with diet, but"
174,00:15:12,00:15:16,spk_0,"you know you can basically, what you want just have small portions of it"
175,00:15:17,00:15:20,spk_0,"just to get you a taste of whatever you want. Sure,"
176,00:15:20,00:15:22,spk_0,that all works
177,00:15:24,00:15:29,spk_0,"and you haven't been sick. And no, nothing. That's good. You got your flu shot? Not yet."
178,00:15:30,00:15:38,spk_0,"I had gotten a flu shot back in February, so it was last year's. But it's gonna get you ready for this year's bugs and being on campus. There's a lot of bugs."
179,00:15:39,00:15:43,spk_0,"Lot of people have been sick at work. Yeah, it seems like colds and stuff, but"
180,00:15:59,00:16:15,spk_0,"so we got a new form here. Just want we want to get on one form your heart history. So have you ever had a heart attack? No. Never had a stroke. You ever been told you have heart failure? No. Ever been bypass surgery? Stents, grafts, angioplasty, amputations? No."
181,00:16:16,00:16:18,spk_0,So now we'll ask you the same questions on this part.
182,00:16:19,00:16:19,spk_0,Okay.
183,00:16:20,00:16:21,spk_0,A little bit of duplication here.

185,00:16:28,00:16:34,spk_0,"um I stopped taking that well over years, maybe almost two years ago. You're doing something to you."
186,00:16:34,00:16:37,spk_0,I I found myself being foggy
187,00:16:39,00:16:44,spk_0,is your LDL was 1 24 when we did your 24 month visit.

193,00:17:01,00:17:05,spk_0,"and using people diabetes, they want it less than 100 because the LDL is the bad cholesterol."
194,00:17:08,00:17:10,spk_0,"And the nice thing about statins,"
195,00:17:11,00:17:11,spk_0,if you

197,00:17:19,00:17:23,spk_0,"because you got diabetes, you're more at risk for heart disease. So"
198,00:17:24,00:17:26,spk_0,"and there's other statins out there, too."
199,00:17:27,00:17:28,spk_0,"Um,"
200,00:17:28,00:17:32,spk_0,"that could be possible. Just just give you a little bit of the protective effect of the statin,"
201,00:17:33,00:17:40,spk_0,"hopefully without causing any the brain, fog or stuff or smaller dose. But that's something to talk"
202,00:17:40,00:17:41,spk_0,with your primary about

263,00:21:51,00:21:53,spk_0,"In the last two weeks, any missed doses?"
264,00:21:54,00:21:55,spk_0,Just the one didn't hear.
265,00:22:02,00:22:02,spk_0,"Yeah,"
266,00:22:05,00:22:06,spk_0,all right.
267,00:22:08,00:22:10,spk_0,For four bottles of that.
268,00:22:11,00:22:11,spk_0,Okay.
269,00:22:15,00:22:17,spk_0,For bottles. What? Metformin.
270,00:22:22,00:22:25,spk_0,Oops. Randomized Kartini. A randomized to Januvia.
271,00:22:32,00:22:38,spk_0,"So, Mike, and in theory, drop, Let's say, down a road drafted Januvia after the study,"
272,00:22:39,00:22:41,spk_0,prominent Atlantis dosage goes up
273,00:22:43,00:22:45,spk_0,"spending what you're doing on your weight and your diet. Okay,"
274,00:22:47,00:22:53,spk_0,"But, you know, first see what the price is. There's also medications that the study didn't have"
275,00:22:54,00:22:57,spk_0,"that are also a possibility. Um,"
276,00:22:57,00:23:03,spk_0,"in one that they have had is the Victoza, which combines glucose control with a little bit of weight loss."
277,00:23:04,00:23:05,spk_0,Because
278,00:23:05,00:23:12,spk_0,"the Victoza kind of slows down. How fast your stomach empty see, feel full faster. And there's some weight loss associated."
279,00:23:13,00:23:18,spk_0,"There's also a class of drugs that ended like frozen,"
280,00:23:18,00:23:21,spk_0,that are ones that your kidney has a
281,00:23:22,00:23:24,spk_0,like a sugar threshold of about
282,00:23:24,00:23:30,spk_0,"180 for blood sugar. If you get above 180 you start peeing out sugar, which is how we used to test"
283,00:23:31,00:23:33,spk_0,Cher's in the old days before we had a bunch of your testing
284,00:23:34,00:23:35,spk_0,to urine dipsticks.
285,00:23:36,00:23:42,spk_0,What these medications in this class do is the artificial lower that kidney thresholds or your picture up that
286,00:23:44,00:23:46,spk_0,"essentially normal blood sugars. But you're still spilling sugar out,"
287,00:23:47,00:23:49,spk_0,so you're losing some calories that way.
288,00:23:50,00:23:54,spk_0,"And so there's a little weight loss associated with that, uh,"
289,00:23:54,00:23:58,spk_0,"major side effect of that drug Class East infections. Okay,"
290,00:23:59,00:24:03,spk_0,"because you got a sugar environment. But it's more of a concern for the women than it is for the men. Sure,"
291,00:24:06,00:24:10,spk_0,they have shown medications that class. I have a protective effect on the heart.
292,00:24:11,00:24:12,spk_0,"Problem is, they're super expensive,"
293,00:24:14,00:24:18,spk_0,"Um, but it's also something to check into in terms of insurance coverage. Also,"
294,00:24:20,00:24:21,spk_0,you've got
295,00:24:21,00:24:25,spk_0,a number of different possibilities that all depends on
296,00:24:26,00:24:26,spk_0,cost
297,00:24:27,00:24:30,spk_0,and also your particular situation that
298,00:24:31,00:24:35,spk_0,no medications in this group might have these benefits for you. Whereas these
299,00:24:37,00:24:47,spk_0,"but overall Lantis insulin. You know, there's no maximum dose. You take what you need, And then basically, the only side effect is hypoglycemia. So Lantus is very good."
300,00:24:48,00:24:49,spk_0,And for the
301,00:24:49,00:24:50,spk_0,"most of the people,"
302,00:24:51,00:24:51,spk_0,it's excellent.
303,00:24:54,00:24:59,spk_0,"Okay. What's Ah, Do you have any idea Medicare coverage on Lantus?"
304,00:25:01,00:25:04,spk_0,"I don't know for sure, but I'm sure it's got to be covered by"
305,00:25:05,00:25:10,spk_0,your Medicare. You can shop around for plants to you take it on a list of what your meds are
306,00:25:10,00:25:12,spk_0,to some plan
307,00:25:13,00:25:14,spk_0,"administrator, expert."
308,00:25:15,00:25:16,spk_0,And then he confined you
309,00:25:18,00:25:24,spk_0,"coverage of those meds, cause you know, there's that's your drug coverage, part of the Medicare. So"
310,00:25:25,00:25:28,spk_0,you got to shop around and that's plenty right
311,00:25:29,00:25:34,spk_0,"year? I don't know. I have looked into a chip. Yeah, I'm still employed. Yeah,"
312,00:25:35,00:25:40,spk_0,but then that can change. Your You might have a great plan from this one company. One year
313,00:25:41,00:25:50,spk_0,next year they change what they cover. So you have to go shopping again to see which one's going to hit you bastard. Cover most of your meds at a reasonable cost.
314,00:25:51,00:25:51,spk_0,"Okay,"
315,00:25:52,00:26:01,spk_0,"But you're not on a lot. Medications a lot of people. We see this whole columnist full of shit between cholesterol, blood pressure, three or four different meds."
316,00:26:02,00:26:06,spk_0,"So, yeah, I think I told you the story to two years ago, three years ago."
317,00:26:08,00:26:11,spk_0,"In fact, I think it was just before we started the study. In fact,"
318,00:26:12,00:26:13,spk_0,the doctor was surprised
319,00:26:14,00:26:15,spk_0,he's that I was
320,00:26:16,00:26:18,spk_0,"pleasantly surprised you got into this study,"
321,00:26:19,00:26:25,spk_0,"he said, but, uh, that same visit, he said, I'd like to put you on a blood pressure medicine, and he says Why? I said, My"
322,00:26:26,00:26:28,spk_0,my supposed to lower your
323,00:26:29,00:26:31,spk_0,"It will help lower your blood sugars. And I said,"
324,00:26:32,00:26:36,spk_0,I don't think so. Let's see how this study goes. The
325,00:26:37,00:26:42,spk_0,"what he may have been talking about there, too. Classes of blood pressure meds"
326,00:26:43,00:26:46,spk_0,"that some docks are very proactive,"
327,00:26:46,00:26:49,spk_0,and they will prescribe them because they have a protective effect on the kidneys.
328,00:26:51,00:26:53,spk_0,I just said your blood pressure.
329,00:26:54,00:26:56,spk_0,You know all. How is my kidney function
330,00:26:56,00:27:06,spk_0,"based on the way we look at how much protein you spell in your urine? Because that's using the first sign that the diabetes suspecting kidneys, think of the kidneys, a coffee filter"
331,00:27:07,00:27:14,spk_0,"and the protein are the coffee grounds, and normally the protein particles don't leak out in great"
332,00:27:14,00:27:22,spk_0,"numbers through the kidney. And when the kidney starts throwing a little bit of damage with due to high blood pressure, diabetes"
333,00:27:23,00:27:29,spk_0,sudden will pick up more of these very teeny tiny particles approaching. Sneaking through
334,00:27:29,00:27:31,spk_0,average is less than 30. You're three.
335,00:27:32,00:27:38,spk_0,"That's good. I mean, everybody will have three year for 10 or 15 or 20."
336,00:27:39,00:27:40,spk_0,Normal is less than 30
337,00:27:41,00:27:44,spk_0,and you have 2.61
338,00:27:45,00:27:47,spk_0,2.4.
339,00:27:48,00:27:51,spk_0,"You got a teen teenage kidneys,"
340,00:27:52,00:27:52,spk_0,so that's
341,00:27:53,00:28:01,spk_0,"looking for damaging the kidneys. The other thing we look at is your serum creatinine, which is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering out"
342,00:28:02,00:28:04,spk_0,"creatinine, which is a waste product of muscle metabolism."
343,00:28:06,00:28:15,spk_0,"And you you've been normal all the time in that respect. And then the other thing is there estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is"
344,00:28:16,00:28:19,spk_0,fancy term for how fast your kidneys are filtering and you're
345,00:28:20,00:28:23,spk_0,"find there, too. So all your kidney tests are excellent,"
346,00:28:26,00:28:27,spk_0,"but yeah, there are some docks that"
347,00:28:28,00:28:33,spk_0,for somebody that's got borderline one thirties may say no good.
348,00:28:33,00:28:36,spk_0,This is good for your blood pressure. And it's good for your kidneys
349,00:28:37,00:28:40,spk_0,because this is actually protective effect of the kidney. So
350,00:28:41,00:28:41,spk_0,you're good
351,00:28:53,00:29:02,spk_0,"in the last few months, have you had to call a healthcare provider for any issue? Were concerned? No email. Anybody know? See anybody in person? No,"
352,00:29:02,00:29:06,spk_0,"it's too. And you've had, uh, your exam. Your"
353,00:29:07,00:29:09,spk_0,"Yeah, that had that in February."

454,00:36:25,00:36:26,spk_0,"Yeah,"
455,00:36:26,00:36:29,spk_0,"And then at night, um,"
456,00:36:29,00:36:36,spk_1,"I mean, you can throw in a few nuts or something, You know, something simple, but not a lot, because they're high in calories, but they're really nutritious"

469,00:37:20,00:37:20,spk_0,"pasta,"
470,00:37:21,00:37:24,spk_1,which is also a lot of broth and vegetables like that.
471,00:37:27,00:37:27,spk_0,"Um,"
472,00:37:30,00:37:31,spk_0,that's pretty much it.

474,00:37:36,00:37:39,spk_0,"Just that much? Just e mean other than, um,"
475,00:37:40,00:37:44,spk_0,"occasionally some corn or some peas, but nothing."
476,00:37:44,00:37:45,spk_1,Yeah.
477,00:37:47,00:37:54,spk_1,"So, you know, it sounds like you're getting at least three servings of fruits and vegetables a day."
478,00:37:54,00:37:59,spk_0,"Yes. I don't skip meals. Um, I go crazy when I miss a meal."
479,00:37:59,00:38:00,spk_1,You get really hungry?
480,00:38:00,00:38:01,spk_0,Yeah.
481,00:38:01,00:38:07,spk_0,For example. Let's say I eat it 5. 30 in the morning. So by 11. 30
482,00:38:07,00:38:08,spk_1,"Yeah, I'm"
483,00:38:09,00:38:15,spk_1,"ready for Well, that's interesting. You say that I wonder if you have you ever tested your blood sugar that?"
484,00:38:15,00:38:18,spk_0,"No, Because that's too much of a house. Yeah, but it could."
485,00:38:18,00:38:31,spk_1,"But maybe just a couple times, because, you know, I don't want you on too much insulin that that could be causing your hunger where you know, you're having to eat to keep your sugars out. Because,"
486,00:38:32,00:38:33,spk_1,"you know, I"
487,00:38:34,00:38:54,spk_1,"It may be that you're just hungry, but I would want to rule out that it is like, Oh, your sugar is starting to fall. And that's why you're really hungry at that time. So And if that is the case, then I would advocate cutting back to Lantus a little bit. Okay? No, um so maybe just check that. You know what? Bring my travel pack with"
488,00:38:55,00:38:59,spk_1,"maybe for a week, check every day before inch look and then see how that goes."
489,00:39:01,00:39:05,spk_1,What other times of the day do you notice that? Does that happen at other times that today?
490,00:39:05,00:39:06,spk_0,"Well, it, um"
491,00:39:07,00:39:11,spk_0,"at night I want to come home. See, I start work at"
492,00:39:12,00:39:17,spk_0,I'm on the bus by six o'clock. Morning. So I start working According to seven.
493,00:39:17,00:39:18,spk_0,I'm
494,00:39:19,00:39:26,spk_0,"home by 5. 15. I test at that time. Okay, I'm very hungry at that."
495,00:39:26,00:39:28,spk_1,"Yeah, And sugar is not low it that,"
496,00:39:29,00:39:32,spk_0,"you know, it's in the eighties."
497,00:39:33,00:39:33,spk_1,Eighty's.
498,00:39:34,00:39:34,spk_1,Okay.
499,00:39:36,00:39:41,spk_0,"In some seventies. Yeah, it could. It could vary from mid seventies to get eighties"
500,00:39:41,00:39:43,spk_0,in the morning and in the afternoon
501,00:39:44,00:40:09,spk_1,"because, you know, I mean, I want you to maintain a healthy weight, but I don't want insulin to be stimulating your appetite. So my hunch is we may need to cut you back a couple units just across the board usually, Um, but let's get some data. See where that is. Certainly, if you're kind of regularly in the seventies before meals, e probably cut you back a couple of units and just see where things are. Um,"
502,00:40:10,00:40:11,spk_1,"you know, and"
503,00:40:12,00:40:17,spk_1,"I think your let's see, your weight is 107 so, you know Yeah,"
504,00:40:18,00:40:25,spk_1,"I'd like to see you a little bit lower. And the weight, you know, just a far as having a good cardiovascular profile and things like that. Just,"
505,00:40:25,00:40:27,spk_0,"you know, the goal would be to 20."
506,00:40:27,00:40:39,spk_1,"Yeah, because your heart, you're very tall still, you know, So maybe just a little bit cutting back. So anything we can do to help this forest not making you more hungry than you need to be. That could be a good thing"
507,00:40:40,00:40:42,spk_0,to cut to the quick. It's way too many sweets.
508,00:40:42,00:40:43,spk_1,Yeah.
509,00:40:43,00:40:47,spk_0,"I mean, uh, it's it's the candy bars, the ice cream. But"
510,00:40:48,00:40:56,spk_0,"it's the building. It's It's the Yeah, it's It's the stuff that I know in my head. Yeah, it should be eating."
511,00:40:56,00:40:57,spk_1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah,"
512,00:40:59,00:41:05,spk_1,"I think just But like you do, you bring good things to work. And so if you bring them, you'll eat. Um,"
513,00:41:05,00:41:07,spk_0,and those things I like.
514,00:41:07,00:41:32,spk_1,"Yeah. Yeah. And so just making sure. And I filling up on the good things before I haven't had the other junk. You know, those are important things I would also advocate may be adding in an extra fruit, maybe at breakfast or something like that. You know, instead of just doing the Cheerios because we do know that processed foods tend to actually increase your appetite. And so trying to have more whole foods and less processed foods can really make a difference."
515,00:41:33,00:42:16,spk_1,"Um, so just having a little bit more. Um, you know, ideally, somewhere between seven and 10 fruits and vegetables a day That sounds like a lot for a lot of people, but I think the point is just raise. Raise that a little bit. You know, fruits and vegetables have a ton of fiber, lots of nutritional, you know, value. And they kind of bulk you up. So you feel fuller in it's low calorie. So trying to bump that one more? Yeah. Yeah. So I just say, like, um, increase fruits and vegetable to somewhere between five and 10 a day, Something like that. But you're in. You're in about 33 a day, so it's not much to add, but maybe add a little something at breakfast. If you had something at breakfast, maybe,"
516,00:42:16,00:42:19,spk_1,"um, you won't be quite as hungry. Also at"
517,00:42:19,00:42:27,spk_0,"lunch, I used to, uh, zap a couple of these tiny pork links in the morning. Uh huh. Um,"
518,00:42:27,00:42:30,spk_0,and they found myself and I've gotten away from that habit.
519,00:42:30,00:42:30,spk_1,"Yeah,"
520,00:42:30,00:42:32,spk_0,but I found myself not being is hungry.
521,00:42:32,00:42:34,spk_1,"Oh, interesting. Yeah,"
522,00:42:34,00:42:36,spk_0,with a higher fat
523,00:42:37,00:42:38,spk_0,keeps your
524,00:42:40,00:42:41,spk_0,Do you recommend that?
525,00:42:41,00:42:50,spk_1,"Well, you know, it depends what they are feeling again. Like, you know, those again are like processed meats, which we're trying to avoid so I would say, you know,"
526,00:42:51,00:42:52,spk_1,know
527,00:42:53,00:43:15,spk_1,"if it's an occasional thing, it's not a big deal, but, like on a regular basis, um, we know processed meats kind of increased cardiovascular risk and increase some cancer risks. And so, trying to have more, like regular meats, you know, just kind of, you know, a pizza piece of meat that's unprocessed is much better than a process kind of sausage, bacon, turkey, those sort of things, you know?"
528,00:43:15,00:43:16,spk_0,So Doc would
529,00:43:16,00:43:18,spk_1,"find that start it, start it,"
530,00:43:19,00:43:20,spk_1,"um, you know,"
531,00:43:21,00:43:22,spk_0,going shooting bad
532,00:43:22,00:43:23,spk_1,"eggs,"
533,00:43:24,00:43:45,spk_1,"Just like, you know, like, you buy chicken breasts. You by That is, you buy, you know, pieces of meat. I think you know, Truman a little bit of a fat off. And things like that can be helpful. But you're not gonna have that for breakfast. You're not gonna have time to go wake up and eat that right. But, um, you know, adding an exit breakfast is a great idea because it's high in protein."
534,00:43:45,00:43:46,spk_1,It's a
535,00:43:46,00:43:47,spk_0,"pain in the butt. Yeah,"
536,00:43:47,00:43:53,spk_0,"it's twitch time. Yeah. I mean, you get up at five. You got to be out the door by court"
537,00:43:53,00:43:58,spk_1,"and six Yeah, we're even just boiling, um, the night before having boiled eggs. Do you, like, boy likes? Don't"
538,00:43:59,00:44:00,spk_1,think.
539,00:44:00,00:44:06,spk_1,"But I think what you're doing is fine. You know, nuts are always a great source of protein that's"
540,00:44:06,00:44:07,spk_0,"there. There's plenty of those at home,"
541,00:44:08,00:44:09,spk_0,"you know, We're"
542,00:44:09,00:44:17,spk_1,"just a small little, you know, a couple tablespoons. And that's, you know, just put him in a little container. Having with you kind of stays off a little bit of hunger as well."
543,00:44:17,00:44:18,spk_1,"You know, he"
544,00:44:18,00:44:22,spk_0,was also talking about substituting. Is ice cream bar
545,00:44:22,00:44:24,spk_0,for for graves?
546,00:44:24,00:44:30,spk_1,"Yeah, great idea. See, Then you'll bulk up your fruits and vegetable section and reduce your calories. So"
547,00:44:30,00:44:42,spk_1,"there's a really nice I mean, it all depends on your goals. Not everybody wants to lose weight, But if you have that as a goal, have you seen that NIDDK and I. D. V K weight loss calculator?"
548,00:44:43,00:44:45,spk_1,"I don't know if you've seen that,"
549,00:44:46,00:44:46,spk_1,so that
550,00:44:47,00:44:55,spk_1,"basically it's a very realistic calculators. See, like if I want to lose X number of pounds in this much time,"
551,00:44:55,00:45:04,spk_1,"what's my caloric and take half to be? And it's really nice because it's more scientifically sound than some of the ones that you could just find online. Um,"
552,00:45:04,00:45:06,spk_0,so it's a nap?
553,00:45:06,00:45:17,spk_1,"No, it's just you go to their website and you can just It's the National Institute of Digestive. Something in kidney disease. What's an idea? Case stand for? I should know that."
554,00:45:18,00:45:24,spk_1,"Um, so it's like through the National Institutes of Health that they have a very nice"
555,00:45:25,00:45:50,spk_1,"tracker just to kind of say Okay, this is my goal. This is my current weight. This is my current level of activity. And this is where I want to be in x number of weeks, months, things like that. And so it basically will tell you if you're at this current weight, this is approximately how many calories you're consuming per day. And if you want to get to this weight, this is where we need to go. And it gives you a very"
556,00:45:51,00:46:03,spk_1,"realistic expectation of how much you need to be eating calorie wise and also encourages you to do more whole whole foods kind of like really food, not processed foods"
557,00:46:03,00:46:07,spk_1,because of the it really does make a difference in in your appetite.
558,00:46:07,00:46:09,spk_0,You used to just figuring that Take
559,00:46:10,00:46:14,spk_0,Yeah. Yeah. You should lose 1 to Â£2 per week.
560,00:46:14,00:46:15,spk_1,Yes.
561,00:46:15,00:46:16,spk_1,You need more
562,00:46:16,00:46:19,spk_0,than 10 calories per pound. Maintain
563,00:46:20,00:46:24,spk_0,"your weight. You'd be running a 500 calorie deficit, which is a pound a week."
564,00:46:24,00:46:25,spk_1,"Yeah,"
565,00:46:27,00:46:30,spk_1,but if you took like a week and actually looked it
566,00:46:31,00:47:03,spk_1,"accurately counted what you're actually eating calorie wise. Not that you want to do this, but if you were interested in you really said I really want to get to Â£220 and I'm now 235. You know, it's only Â£15. It sounds like a lot, but it's really not that much. What do I need to get their? You're probably gonna be trimming about 500 to 600 calories a day out of your diet. So if you think about like, oh, the ice cream bar now I'm gonna have Grave's that's gonna cut it quite a bit, you know, like little things like that."
567,00:47:03,00:47:04,spk_0,So that quick math would be
568,00:47:05,00:47:19,spk_0,Â£235 times 10 is a broad roughly 2300 calories. 23 50. That sample menus. Sure you would. So I get days of 2300 calorie consists of for you gives you breakfast. Lunch is and summers.
569,00:47:19,00:47:22,spk_0,It may not be food that you like. It'll give you an idea of
570,00:47:22,00:47:24,spk_0,what it's running 300 calorie and they
571,00:47:26,00:47:30,spk_0,but with exercise and I come in and 18 1900 count
572,00:47:30,00:47:50,spk_1,"Well, so I think the truth is exercise. You know, we exercise is not going to make you lose weight in the absence of diet change. It's just that's a wonderful thing to do. Is general health. It's great for your heart and diabetes and everything else but that in of itself, without making dietary changes and gonna make a difference in how your weight 40"
573,00:47:50,00:47:51,spk_0,five minutes

577,00:48:02,00:48:05,spk_1,"Just killed. Yeah, but you've done good things for you,"
578,00:48:08,00:48:23,spk_1,"but anyway, I think stop talking. I think you are not in a, you know, dangerous zone of be, you know, very overweight. But I'm just saying, if you want a goal of kind of losing, all right, it down. But it's an I d D K um, weight"
579,00:48:25,00:48:43,spk_1,"track or weight loss calculator or something like that, but it's sort of It's pretty nice. I think you've got a very good diet. I think you're right. It's those little things that kind of the little snacks or things that aren't what we consider what we eat all the time. Those are the things that kind of add up."
580,00:48:43,00:48:47,spk_0,"It's a craving. Know, Doc. It is'. I mean, it's like at eight o'clock, I gotta have something,"
581,00:48:47,00:48:48,spk_1,"something sweet. Yeah,"
582,00:48:49,00:48:51,spk_0,And he's thinking about this last night before this appointment.
583,00:48:54,00:48:54,spk_0,This is don't
584,00:48:58,00:49:14,spk_1,"Yeah, You got to enjoy yourself and a half those things every once in a while, but maybe just not on a daily basis, you know? And I think I think, Oh, I when I have that I got to go for an extra walk. I'm going to do something different to kind of compensate for, you know,"
585,00:49:14,00:49:18,spk_0,like my gas is my A one C is gonna be somewhere between 6872
586,00:49:18,00:49:36,spk_1,"Yeah, you're probably right. But it looks like you're doing really well. We're just trying to find little things to help you. Um, but I'm I'm guessing maybe We'll want to drop that Lantus down a little bit. Januvia will leave the same metformin. Leave the same. Just try bumping up the fruits and vegetables a little bit, maybe cutting sweets down a little,"
587,00:49:37,00:49:39,spk_1,"But overall, you're doing great."
588,00:49:39,00:49:42,spk_0,Maybe the month of November. Just go for it. See how it goes.
589,00:49:42,00:49:45,spk_1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're doing awesome that we're getting"
590,00:49:45,00:49:48,spk_0,"into that time of year, though, because you have to do, like, I always get home."
591,00:49:49,00:49:50,spk_0,Suffer.
592,00:49:51,00:49:59,spk_0,"Lot of us just sit around with on TV Year. What sports, whereas before he wrote the are doing stuff, I think this is a tough time of year."
593,00:50:00,00:50:08,spk_1,"Do you have any kind of, um so do you just usually do your walking outside or just on campus while you're working? Both. Yeah."
594,00:50:09,00:50:09,spk_0,"I mean, um,"
595,00:50:10,00:50:15,spk_0,"I walk every morning from Kaufman. Done. You know,"
596,00:50:16,00:50:18,spk_0,"um, I walk"
597,00:50:19,00:50:22,spk_0,"from here to there, obviously, but I I walked"
598,00:50:23,00:50:25,spk_0,easily three miles a day.
599,00:50:25,00:50:35,spk_1,"That's awesome. Good. Good. Keeping that up is great. I started talking about the diet a little bit more just because we were thinking like, okay, cholesterol wise."
600,00:50:35,00:50:41,spk_1,"If you're not on the medication, how can we worked on that as well in fruits and vegetables is probably one of the best ways."
601,00:50:41,00:50:44,spk_0,Should I give the medication to try? I still have some left over
602,00:50:45,00:51:31,spk_1,"work on some dietary. You know, if you really had side effects and that got better when you stopped it, I would wait, Talk to your doctor. You may want to consider a lower dose of a different medication that may not have the same okay effect, but I think the cornerstone for treating cholesterol, diabetes, everything is dying, you know, diet activity. And so, trying to focus mostly on that. Be interesting to see how dietary changes can affect your cholesterol, you know. And then, if you're still struggling despite kind of trying to eat more fruits, vegetables, more plant based foods, less processed foods, then maybe it's time to consider another, um, medication, you know, but I like to give you a good try on the diet before another medication is tried, especially from bad side effects."
603,00:51:32,00:51:35,spk_1,"Um, any other concerns or questions? Think"
604,00:51:35,00:51:36,spk_0,about transition
605,00:51:37,00:51:38,spk_0,"from, uh,"
606,00:51:39,00:51:48,spk_0,"study. That's to be oh, interesting recommendations, because instead of results until after January of 22"
607,00:51:49,00:51:50,spk_1,22
608,00:51:53,00:51:55,spk_0,because we end April of
609,00:51:56,00:51:57,spk_0,22 Morning.
610,00:51:57,00:51:58,spk_1,"0, 21. Yes. Yes,"
611,00:52:00,00:52:25,spk_1,"that's true. So, yeah. I mean, as far as I think, most studies typically recommend just continuing on what you're on in the study after it's over, especially if it's working. But of lot of times, you know, some medications are more expensive or you know things like that, and you've got to think of the practical, Um, definitely metformin's dirt cheap. It's been around forever, and something better we would not recommend stopping"
612,00:52:26,00:52:36,spk_1,"Atlanta's. You know, I think the combination of what you're on is working really well. And so if your insurance is able to cover it and continue, I would just continue"
613,00:52:37,00:52:42,spk_1,"with the university. Yeah, yeah. Um, And then the other thing is, um,"
614,00:52:43,00:52:49,spk_1,"you know, there are newer classes of medications that have actually come out since the study has ended. Um, that are,"
615,00:52:50,00:53:07,spk_1,"you know, also very good in protective of cardiovascular risk. Again, they're newer, and they're more expensive as well. So it's going to be a balance and trying to find out what's the best treatment. But as far as controlling your diabetes, you're doing it a wonderful job On what you're taking,"
616,00:53:08,00:53:10,spk_0,"um, I on animal insulin. Or is it?"
617,00:53:10,00:53:27,spk_1,"No, it's synthetic. Yeah, it's human. Recombinant DNA. So it's a recompeting insulin. So it's basically just very similar to what human insulin is, but it's synthetic. Does not animal. Yeah. The previous insulins years ago used to be pork and"
618,00:53:28,00:53:30,spk_0,sure. Do they still make that or? No.
619,00:53:30,00:53:31,spk_1,"No,"
620,00:53:32,00:53:35,spk_1,"I don't think so. They don't still make pork insulin, do they?"
621,00:53:37,00:53:38,spk_1,I don't know how they would either.
622,00:53:39,00:53:39,spk_1,Yeah.
