Okay, Well, is going to drop your average is so it might make it seem less realistic if your numbers are high. Because the little numbers will offset it. So we try not to get, you know, share meters just for that purpose. But I'm initially if it was Yeah. Okay. So it probably won't make a big difference on on everything for you. The numbers count is okay. So, trying to think about that right now, just relax, maybe think about, you know, a nice beach in Hawaii, and I will be back in five minutes.
